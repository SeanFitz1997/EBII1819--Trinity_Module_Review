Module Learning Aims:
Single Honors students in Junior Sophister year are required to do a project in
applied psychology. This project is undertaken as a group exercise with groups of
around five to eight students.
There are several objectives of this module:
1. To develop an understanding of the role (actual or potential) of psychology or of
professional psychologists in addressing issues or topics of concern in -the real
world'.
2. To develop an ability to undertake applied research using appropriate
methodologies which can support a consultancy role. This involves developing
and presenting appropriate and authoritative knowledge which can inform better
policy or practice in the relevant area. This does not necessarily require the
independent collection of new scientific data which is the primary role of the final
year project.
3. To foster the ability to work effectively as a group or team.
4. To develop awareness of group processes
Module Content:
Topics for these projects are selected and agreed during the first 2-3 weeks of the first semester and each group is expected to produce and present a project plan by the end of week 3. The groups are expected to meet regularly during the scheduled 2 hour seminar throughout the academic year. These meetings
' assist the development of the groups as effective support systems
' help the groups achieve the specific tasks of the project (e.g. defining goals sharing responsibilities defining tasks assessing progress rehearsing presentations).
In each group all members are responsible for:
' getting all members of the group involved in the project fairly
' allocating responsibilities and ensuring they are fulfilled
' using the course leaders to attain the goals of the project in the best possible way.
Periodic review sessions involving the whole class will be held to monitor progress. Proposals normally develop in a number of stages and the empirical work which is supported by those proposals often occurs in stages.
Therefore each group will be required to produce a documented proposal for all the work they are doing at each particular stage. This may be a `rolling' document which is updated as the project progresses.
Each significant version of the proposal (i.e. which supports some new empirical work) will be accompanied by the ethics form which includes an ethics checklist.
The completed ethics form for each project is forwarded to the ethics committee for their approval prior to commencement of the research.
As part of the group projects module there will be a short programme on team working and project management. This will take place during the fourth week of the first semester.

• describe and assess the key theoretical perspectives on discursive social psychology
• evaluate and appreciate the relevance of discursive research to social psychological concerns
• explain the principles and methods involved in doing research in the area.
Module Learning Aims:
The main aim of this module is to examine and demonstrate how talk (or text) in everyday settings or particular institutional settings such as in parliaments is centrally implicated in social behaviour. It will examine theory research and applied perspectives on how social behaviour is accomplished in and through discourse. It will provide students with an understanding of social and discursive constructionist approaches to social behaviour.

This module provides students with a critical understanding of how discursive research examines and informs social psychological concerns. It particularly aims to provide students with up-to-date knowledge of research and theoretical advances in the area.

The module then covers topics such as discourse analysis – theory and method; identities; prejudice: construction and negotiation of problematic claims; construction and negotiation of gender and sexual orientation; and discursive negotiation of Law & Order.

Alongside these the module will have two analytic sessions / workshops of half-hour each to familiarize the students with discursive research. The main aim of these workshops is to provide the students with some on-hand analytic practice in discursive research so that they may better appreciate how discursive research informs our understanding of social behaviour and social lives.

PS3416,Moral Development In Childhood,Clare Kelly,"Learning Outcomes:
Morality and Childhood is a one-semester optional course available to Junior and Senior Sophister Psychology students. The module explores the science of morality a burgeoning field that has emerged at the intersection of developmental social and evolutionary psychology philosophy and neuroscience and now forms a core component of the scientific study of human nature.

On successful completion of this module students will be able to:

Characterise and evaluate the main theoretical perspectives in the psychology of morality.

Compare and critically evaluate theories on the development of morality in childhood.

Explain and evaluate current perspectives on the biological and evolutionary origins of morality.

Assess and compare the roles of biological social and cultural influences on morality in childhood and beyond including family school religion peers literature and the media.

Explore and analyze hate and prejudice from the perspective of the science of morality and moral development.
Module Learning Aims:
This module tackles questions such as: How do children come to know right from wrong? Do we enter the world as blank moral slates who must learn right and wrong or are we born with an innate moral sense? How do parents peers school culture and the media influence and shape our moral development?

To answer these questions we first define morality and learn about how it is studied scientifically. We then talk about behavioural and neuroimaging research that has been conducted with babies children and adults as well as non-human animals and what this research with each of these can tell us about morality where it comes from and how it develops during childhood. Next we consider in more detail the role of parents peers school and society in shaping morality from infancy to adulthood. We will consider how today’s youth negotiate the challenges of the modern world including bullying in school and on the Internet the influence of the media and popular culture. Finally we discuss the “dark side” of human morality and how it can help us to understand hate and prejudice.

Module Learning Aims:
Social Neuroscience is one of the newest fields in Psychology and explores the neural systems underlying social behavior. Emerging from a synthesis of ideas and methods from social psychology and the neurosciences social neuroscience seeks to broaden our understanding of human brain function beyond basic motor perceptual and cognitive processes by elucidating the brain’s fundamental role in governing interpersonal relations. This endeavour has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of how the brain works and at the same time to refine theories of social processes. The course will outline the theoretical origins of the field basic neuroanatomy and core methodologies including brain imaging techniques and behavioural paradigms. In addition key areas that will be covered include how the brain enables the processing of faces emotions theory of mind prejudice and stereotypes moral judgments and economic decision making. In so doing the course will highlight prominent disorders of social function such as autism and how limitations in seemingly ‘non-social’ cognitive abilities can greatly influence our social behavior. Finally the course will also consider some of the ethical implications associated with our growing understanding of the neural determinants of interpsonal behaviour and the impact this knowledge can have on our notion of free will and responsibility.

Module Learning Aims:
Rationale and Aims

The course title ‘The Brain through the life course’ is intended to convey the idea that there are other ways of approaching the study of brain structure and function beyond the conventional focus of parsing cognitive affective and others functions using standard tools (such as brain imaging). There is a very large amount of important and interesting research work being conducted at the intersection of the brain other disciplines and society at large. These topics vary dramatically: they can include the impact of the brain sciences on the courtroom to understanding the nature of the brain’s response during aesthetic experience or neurobiology of poverty and adversity on development.

The course is therefore intended to broaden and deepen the understanding of the student of the cognitive and brain sciences as they impact on the individual and their place and interaction with development family and society at large. The course therefore will explore topics of contemporary relevance and interest to the individual and society at large on the implications of discoveries about brain and cognitive function through the prism generated by the brain and cognitive sciences. It is intended that the course will be broad and deep moving from the immediacy of the impact of the local familial environment to the effects of poverty and adversity on brain development structure and function to considering the nature of the neuroaesthetic response to questions of ethics and law and finally to extreme brain states (e.g. torture) and a consideration of principles-based counterfactual neuroscience analysis (‘impossible’ brains such as the zombie brain).

Module Learning Aims:
This module will cover approaches to understanding perception and cognition from the perspective that these functions can only be considered sensibly in an action context. Consideration will be given to exemplars drawn from various areas of psychology that serve to illustrate the role of movement in aspects of perception and cognition regarded traditionally as being independent of the means of effect. The module will deal with observations defined at the level of behaviour. It will also include evidence drawn from the neurosciences - concerning brain activity subserving perception cognition and motor function that bears upon these issues. In addition consideration will be given to some of the related philosophical questions that are raised. The student is also introduced to the possibility that intervention strategies thus informed may be used to maintain or enhance cognitive performance.

Module Content:
Personal Development - Group Process: The group process is an opportunity for students to experience themselves in relation to others in the group. While recognising that work in the group will inevitably touch off and bring up the past experiences of individuals the emphasis of the work is on the here and now present. As group members discover how they are creating their own experience in a group this opens up the possibility of choosing to respond differently. The facilitator's role is to track and support the emerging interactive process. Confidentiality between the group facilitator and the students is highly respected.

Personal Development - Personal Counselling: Each student is required to undertake individual counselling throughout the 3 years (25 sessions per year).

Personal Development - Workshops: There will be several workshops to develop self awareness the recognition of each individual's uniqueness and personal style group dynamics self-care and how to use personal process therapeutically. Techniques will be offered which will help raise the students' knowledge of their own process and how it may effect the counselling situation.

Module Content:
This module aims to develop and support the student’s clinical experience and competence for their clinical placement client work through regular participation in the supervisory relationship provided by small group supervision. As soon as placements begin students have weekly small group supervision during each term. Students present their cases concerns and questions receive feedback from group members and supervisor to further their own personal process and to enhance their developing skills. Each student is required to present several cases including tapes and transcripts of their sessions to facilitate discussion and feedback. Small group supervision is provided for throughout Years 1 2 and 3. In line with our course philosophy a collaborative learning environment is promoted. From the outset each supervisee is considered to be capable of making a valuable and unique contribution to the learning of the group. Overall the module aims to support students in developing clinical practice which is:

Self-reflective

Clinically competent

Culturally sensitive

Informed and guided by theoretical understanding and evidence based practice

Informed and guided by supervisory processes

Adheres to PSI Ethical Framework for Best Practice and Equality and Inclusive Practice Policy


Purpose
Small Group Supervision serves the following functions:

A training function which involves facilitating the trainee to integrate theory with practice and to develop competent practice

A supportive function by maintaining the trainee’s personal and professional well-being with respect to client work. There is also some degree of

A managerial function which the group supervisor will exercise if they consider the student’s practice to require major improvements / to be unethical / lacking competence / or presenting fitness to practice concerns. This function provides a degree of protection for the trainee’s clients and the trainee’s well-being. However the accountability for providing appropriate supervision and management of the clinical work is with the individual supervisor and the placement agency who are the providers of the counselling service to the agencies clients. Trainees are required to be in placement-provided supervision as the agency (not the course) holds clinical accountability for their clients.

Module Content:
Supervisor Responsibilities: Each student will select a research supervisor and advise the Course Director of the nature of the area of proposed research to be considered. Role of the Supervisor The supervisor will; - Assist in selecting and developing a topic for research - Advise on a literature search - Advise on ethical and practical issues - Monitor data collection and general progress - Advise on data analysis - Advise on the format and content of the dissertation.


Student Responsibilities: The student will maintain regular contact with the research supervisor throughout and in collaboration with the supervisor will devise a timetable based on a task analysis exercise for the work to be completed. Students are required to strictly adhere to academic conventions as detailed in the College Calendar and Course Handbook. They are also required to obtain ethical approval before undertaking any data collection for their research project.

Word Count Limit: In light of the recommendation that the write-up of the dissertation should be more like a draft for journal publication rather than the traditional idea of a dissertation or thesis the word count for the substantial elements of the work should be kept to a minimum. For example journal articles all have guidelines for authors and these tend to range in word count from 3000 to 6000. Some qualitative publications may allow more for extended text analyses. However it is recommended that you read around author guidelines from key journals that are pertinent to your research area and take a general guide from there. In any event the maximum total length for the dissertation is 10000 words including references appendices tables ethics material transcripts data etc. This should not be submitted with the hard copy of the dissertation unless you consider it is absolutely necessary. Therefore all this kind of material should be submitted only in electronic format.

By considering the conscious and unconscious meanings of the events and behaviour of the infant’s early relationships aspects of emotional development will be explored by working through the various stages of the child’s development.

 
Module Content:
Many of our fears and phantasies doubts and difficulties are relics of earlier phases of life no longer relevant to the adult world in which we find ourselves. Freud concurred with Wordsworth who proclaimed that ‘the child is father of the man’. This enables us to be more aware and considerate of the ‘child within’ (Sandler 1992) that lives on in the unconscious mind and continues to influence our adults thoughts and actions. In working towards an understanding of the emotional world of the child the emphasis will be on object relations theory and infant observation material as tools to help us understand the modes of learning within relationships paying attention to topics such as:

Foetal life/birth experiences/the family into which baby is born (Parents Siblings Intergenerational influences).

First relationships – ‘Good enough parenting’: Primary maternal preoccupation/ Primitive-early object relations/fantasy and phantasy/ anxiety/ attunement feeding holding the importance of the skin containment bringing meaning attachment etc.

Internal organisations including splitting projection introjections projective identification paranoid schizoid/depressive positions reparation psychic retreats denial omnipotence

The false self/primitive guilt envy gratitude reparation/when caregiver fails

Weaning/separation/individuation/deprivation

Module Content:
A thesis proposal should be submitted in the third week of the second term though a student may submit this proposal earlier and have it considered in advance of this date. In the latter situation the student should contact the course director to discuss the idea and to discuss how it might be developed into a thesis. Agreement is reached between the student and the course director on an appropriate supervisor at the time when the proposal is received and discussed. A list of prospective supervisors areas of interest and contact details is provided for students. A list of supervisors who are available to supervise students on the MPhil is made available to students over the course of the year to reflect who is available to provide this support. Supervisors are generally drawn from teachers on the course and who may have an interest in the general area from which the student is writing the thesis.

Five tutorials are organised with the class in between the first and second terms to provide guidance on the development of a research theme the sourcing of relevant literature the writing of an academic dissertation in the field of psychoanalysis. Sample dissertations completed by students on the course in previous years are distributed. Each student meets with the course director as they prepare a dissertation proposal. Students also engage in approximately four one hour meetings with the supervisor. The timing of these is organised between student and supervisor. Students are advised around how best to use the supervisory relationship and the use of feedback in revising written work.


A great deal of flexibility is offered around the choice of the subject matter of the thesis. The course aims to provide students with supervision in a wide range of areas. Students are encouraged to complete dissertations on areas which are of personal and professional relevance and to draw on a range of psychoanalytic theories and approaches in putting these together. A student may wish to focus on:

A specific psychoanalytic theoretical position in relation to a well-defined topic;

The history of psychoanalytic thinking in relation to a particular idea;

The application of psychoanalysis to the understanding of a cultural social or other phenomenon that is of interest to the student.

All dissertations must be written within a specific psychoanalytic framework or contrast a number of psychoanalytic frameworks. Students are encouraged to approach the subject matter in a critical questioning way.

Module Learning Aims:
This module is designed to provide students with an opportunity to explore psychoanalytic ideas around the media of literature and film.
Module Content:
This module explores psychoanalysis and the arts and in particular how psychoanalysis has understood film. Psychoanalytic film theory represents a development of cine-semiotics for both linguistic studies and psychoanalytic studies are sciences of meaning of signification. Some film theorists highlight a relationship between the way the human psyche and cinematic representation operate and asserted that Freudâ€™s theory of human subjectivity and unconscious production can illuminate the textual processes involved in film-making and viewing. One of the aims therefore of this course is to explore psychoanalytic film theory as a systematic comparison of the cinema - a kind of spectacle with the structure of the socially and psychically constituted individual. This module is oriented toward offering an overview of how psychoanalysis can create a discursive strategy which accounts for cinemaâ€™s immediate and pervasive social power. It will do this by displaying how film viewing and subject formation are reciprocal processes â€“ something about our unconscious identity as subjects is reinforced in film viewing and film viewing is effective because of our unconscious participation. The primary aim of this course is to explore psychoanalytic film theory as a systematic comparison of the cinema as a kind of spectacle and the structure of the socially and psychically constituted individual. A secondary aim is to reflect on how recent theoretical developments have resulted in a shift from the systems of meaning within individual films to the production of subjectivity in the film viewing situation.

Increasingly organisational strategy is being driven by the appraisal and analysis of the risks faced by the organisation and its operations. This creates a focus on what the organisation needs to do to meet the challenges in its current environment and anticipate future threats. Core to this is the analysis of operational performance both performance outcomes (using suitable performance indicators) as well as the inputs or antecedents of process performance. This module will focus primarily on the risks that relate to the operational system itself. While one central focus will be on the risk of safety failure this will be in the context of a wider range of managing the risk of managing the overall change itself. The module will locate risk management within the evolution of quality and safety management systems and introduce concepts of probabilistic risk assessments. It will look at the strengths and weaknesses of such systems particularly in relation to their capacity to stimulate change. It will examine the specifically human aspects of risk and reliability. The requirements for a performance-based management system will be examined particularly in the context of complex ultra-safe systems like aviation.

Module Content:
This module aims to develop and support the student’s clinical experience and competence for their clinical placement client work through regular participation in the supervisory relationship provided by small group supervision. As soon as placements begin students have weekly small group supervision during each term. Students present their cases concerns and questions receive feedback from group members and supervisor to further their own personal process and to enhance their developing skills. Each student is required to present several cases including tapes and transcripts of their sessions to facilitate discussion and feedback. Small group supervision is provided for throughout Years 1 2 and 3. In line with our course philosophy a collaborative learning environment is promoted. From the outset each supervisee is considered to be capable of making a valuable and unique contribution to the learning of the group. Overall the module aims to support students in developing clinical practice which is:

Self-reflective

Clinically competent

Culturally sensitive

Informed and guided by theoretical understanding and evidence based practice

Informed and guided by supervisory processes

Adheres to PSI Ethical Framework for Best Practice and Equality and Inclusive Practice Policy

 
Purpose

Small Group Supervision serves the following functions:

A training function which involves facilitating the trainee to integrate theory with practice and to develop competent practice

A supportive function by maintaining the trainee’s personal and professional well-being with respect to client work. There is also some degree of

A managerial function which the group supervisor will exercise if they consider the student’s practice to require major improvements / to be unethical / lacking competence / or presenting fitness to practice concerns. This function provides a degree of protection for the trainee’s clients and the trainee’s well-being. However the accountability for providing appropriate supervision and management of the clinical work is with the individual supervisor and the placement agency who are the providers of the counselling service to the agencies clients. Trainees are required to be in placement-provided supervision as the agency (not the course) holds clinical accountability for their clients.

Module Content:
Personal Development - Group Process: The group process is an opportunity for students to experience themselves in relation to others in the group. While recognising that work in the group will inevitably touch off and bring up the past experiences of individuals the emphasis of the work is on the here and now present. As group members discover how they are creating their own experience in a group this opens up the possibility of choosing to respond differently. The facilitator's role is to track and support the emerging interactive process. Confidentiality between the group facilitator and the students is highly respected.
Personal Development - Personal Counselling: Each student is required to undertake individual counselling throughout the 3 years (25 sessions per year).

Personal Development - Workshops: There will be several workshops to develop self awareness the recognition of each individual's uniqueness and personal style group dynamics self-care and how to use personal process therapeutically. Techniques will be offered which will help raise the students' knowledge of their own process and how it may effect the counselling situation.

Module Content:
Students typically have one primary placement each year. Placements are offered in a variety of settings and the experiences gained will give students a substantial framework within which to integrate theory and practice. Two days each week are spent on placement. Some placement hours may be in the evening or on Saturday by agreement with the placement co-ordinator and the placement site director. Over the three years students are experienced to acquire experience of working with the clients across different lifespan development stages.

Students are expected to see approximately 6 (maximum 8) clients per week at the placement site only and receive 1 hour of case supervision per 5 hours of therapy conducted. They may also be involved in co-facilitating sessions including groups attending case conferences couples and family therapy sessions sitting in on sessions with more senior therapists or home visits (only when accompanied by a site staff member). Students must gain client experience including experience of diversity in at least three settings at least one of which should be in a health care setting. Some secondary placements are also available to provide experience in a different setting or with a different population or age group from the primary placement.
