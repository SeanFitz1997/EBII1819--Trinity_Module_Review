Short Content Overview

Module GE3M07 (for Genetics / Human Genetics students) is a synonym of module MI3M04 (for Microbiology students). Students registered for either of these modules attend the same set of lectures. The laboratory practical module, MI3M04-P, associated with MI3M04 is taken by Microbiology students but not by Genetics/Human Genetics students.
This module presents an evidence-based description of the basic cellular processes of transcription, translation and DNA replication in bacteria. The approach is to discuss in detail the players involved and their roles in each of the processes. The major mechanisms by which bacteria regulate expression of genetic material as well as aspects of bacterial replication and recombination will be discussed. The module covers the major events in transcription initiation, positive and negative control of transcription, coordinated control of transcription, the operon, the regulon, the stimulon, an introduction to global regulation, DNA structure and gene regulation, environmental adaptation through variations in gene expression, stereotypic and stochastic responses, and transposition – including insertion sequences IS1 and IS3 and transposons Tn3 Tn5, Tn7, Tn10 and bacteriophage Mu. Major features of the genetic code and suppression will be discussed together with mechanisms for the initiation, elongation and termination of translation. We will discuss DNA polymerases, the origin of chromosomal DNA replication (oriC) in Escherichia coli and the mechanisms by which the DNA replication is initiated and controlled. The special problems associated with replicating linear genomes and how they are surmounted will be discussed. In this context, the structure of telomeres, how they are replicated with telomerase and their association with aging will be discussed.

See Module Learning Aims

 
Module Learning Aims:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to describe and display understanding of key aspects of:

DNA mutation, repair and recombination

Population genetics

Molecular evolutionary genetics


 
Module Content:
This module provides an introduction to genetic variation – its origins and its evolutionary consequences. The information in DNA is not always transmitted accurately from one generation to the next. DNA sequences can change spontaneously by the process of mutation and inaccurate DNA repair, resulting in genetic variation (polymorphism) within populations. Variable sites at different positions in the genome get shuffled into new combinations by the process of genetic recombination that occurs during sexual reproduction. Whether a particular variant (allele) survives for a long time in a population or goes extinct depends on the evolutionary forces acting on the population. If a new allele is advantageous to the population, Darwinian natural selection will tend to increase its frequency in the population; alternatively, if the new allele is disadvantageous natural selection will tend to eliminate it. However, if the population is small, random events (genetic drift) can overcome the power of natural selection.
