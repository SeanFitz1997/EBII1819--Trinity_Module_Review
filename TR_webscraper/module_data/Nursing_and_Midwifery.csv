Reflection is actively facilitated in a series of ten days (136 hours) over the students' final internship period. These reflective practice facilitation sessions enable participants to independently support reflective practice amongst their peers. The sessions also expose the students to the principles of clinical midwifery supervision. Each day consists of two hours of student peer support of reflective practice. One and a half hours of facilitated group workshops using either hospital case-notes, or art and drama exercises, provide a stimulus to reflection on practice issues. Three further hours of modelled clinical supervision complete the structured element of the reflective days. All of these sessions are supported or facilitated by experienced midwife practitioners from the practice area and midwife lecturers. The remaining hours allow the student to avail of local and university library facilities for the preparation of a reflective portfolio that will provide documentary evidence of each individual's personal and professional development over the internship period. The portfolio will thus be available for the students to bring to potential employers as evidence of their continuing professional development and reflective practice.

Negotiation skills
The essence of this unit of study is for the student to gain an understanding of pregnancy and childbirth through the eyes of the woman. The relationship will include antenatal and postnatal visits and attendance at the birth if this is appropriate and welcomed by the woman. With assistance from midwives in the antenatal clinic and midwifery led services, the student will be facilitated to meet with a woman willing to share her experiences. The accomplishment of the remainder of the requirements of the module is the responsibility of the student. Regular meetings with midwifery lecturers will provide a venue for discussion and reflection.
Research and study into salient aspects of the woman's issues is required. The sources of knowledge that the student accesses to help give `meaning' to these activities must be documented (these will also need to be evident in the log). This process of reflection and recording is a valuable part of the learning experience of this module and will also help in the preparation for the assessment of the unit. Appropriate and pertinent references should be included.

Module Learning Aims:
Effective midwifery practice demands that midwives base their care on current research and evidence. This can only be achieved through the incremental and ongoing development of the skills necessary to access, review, analyse and critique information available nationally and internationally.
The aim of this module is to immerse midwifery students in midwifery knowledge by introducing them to the sources of the seminal readings and research. It is also designed to introduce students to the essential concepts/components upon which midwifery is based and starts with focusing on each student's personal knowledge and means of acquiring knowledge. The module builds on the student's knowledge of the research process. It facilitate them to develop their skills in the process of reviewing, analysing and critiquing research and highlighting implications for practice to ensure that care offered to women is underpinned by the most appropriate evidence based knowledge. Midwifery students will also examine and explore in detail the knowledge and evidence of a particular aspect of midwifery practice of their choosing.

Module Learning Aims:
For organisational purposes, this 6 week period of midwifery practice is made up of a four week placement in either an antenatal, intranatal or postnatal area and a two week community midwifery placement.
The aim of this midwifery practice placement (antenatal, intranatal or postnatal) is to enable students to continue acquire the knowledge, skills and approach to practice to function at a core practice level in a supervised environment. This 2nd 6 week midwifery practice placement in the 1st half of the programme will ensure that midwifery students have had the opportunity to practise in a 2nd core areas of maternity care: antenatal, intranatal and postnatal. Midwifery students will continue to be introduced to the essential components of the professional framework for midwifery practice and the underpinning philosophies of delivering midwifery care. It is expected that the student has begun to take cognisance of the impact of their practice on women and families.
The aim of the community placement is to enable students to experience the provision of midwifery care in a community setting. Working under the supervision of midwives, a placement of this nature will provide students with the opportunity to participate in giving midwifery care to women in a non-hospital/institutional environment such as in the woman's own home environment or in an integrated hospital-community system.
In the past few years alone, the provision of midwifery care in Ireland, in the community arena in particular, has undergone radical alteration. It is the establishment of these new systems of care that permit midwifery students to experience, for the first time in many years in an Irish setting, the state provision of the totality of midwifery care to women in an area out with the institution of the hospital. It is anticipated that experiencing the totality of community midwifery will reinforce and reaffirm pregnancy as a physiological process for many women.

Module Learning Aims:
For organisational purposes, this 6 week period of midwifery practice is made up of a six week placement in the intranatal area and one weeks elective placement.
During the months of this education programme and practising as supervised team members, the practice exposure and experiences that students receive will engender in them a level of confidence and competence which will serve to consolidate previous learning and facilitate the development of reasoned decision making skills in a safe supervised environment. The knowledge and skills required for achieving accurate diagnosis and differential diagnoses will increase and develop to a level of assured accuracy and security in their practice.
The overall aim of an elective placement is to permit students to identify an area/issue related to midwifery and deepen their knowledge and understanding of this self-selected area/issue. An elective placement will give students the time and the opportunity to pursue an area that would otherwise not be explored in depth during their midwifery education. Organising and achieving an elective placement is also expected to aid students in achieving a sense of independence and control over an aspect of their education as well as enhancing their organisational skills and personal development.
Module Content:
Midwifery students will have a 6-week placement in intranatal area and a 1-week elective placement.
Prior to the elective placement, the midwifery student must justify the suitability and relevance of the chosen placement and identify the implications of this placement to her education as a midwifery student and becoming a midwife. The midwifery student is expected to identify and document the desired learning outcomes.

Module Learning Aims:
This module is divided into two units

Unit 1 Sociology

Pregnancy and birth are intensely personal experiences for women. Yet they are also social processes: each woman undertakes childbirth in multi-layered contexts that include the family, community and institutional settings where birth is facilitated.

The aim of this unit on sociology is to enable students to build into their practice as midwives, perspectives and research on birth and mothering drawn from the disciplines of sociology, anthropology and feminist theory. In year one, students will concentrate on the history of midwifery and obstetric medicine in economically advanced societies and the contexts of birth and motherhood for women in contemporary Ireland.

Unit 2 Sharing the Woman’s Experience

The organisation of maternity care in Ireland and, in particular, the delivery of midwifery led care, is such that exposing the midwifery student to the concept of continuity of care/carer is limited in the environment of a tertiary obstetric referral maternity hospital.

The aim of this unit is to attempt to provide the midwifery student with an opportunity to share and listen to one woman’s experience of her pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period. It is envisaged that this experience will provide the student with a social perspective in which the processes of pregnancy and birth take place.

 
 
 
 
Module Content:
This module is divided into two units

Unit 1 Sociology

Sociological concepts; Society; Relationships between the individual, family and society; Role of the family in contemporary society; Experiences of birth in contemporary Ireland; History of childbirth in Ireland and internationally; The issue of fear, risk and birth in contemporary society; The rise of competing ideologies about childbirth; Socialisation of midwives; The role of women and families in society and its impact on pregnancy, childbirth and parenting; Cultural representations of the female body.

Unit 2 Sharing the Woman’s Experience

Childbirth as a normal life event; The views of Irish society on childbirth, motherhood and parenting and the family (including knowledge of the Constitution); Support for the woman in pregnancy, childbirth and postnatally (including the types of support); Choices for maternity care – providers and environment ; Community support groups e.g. community mothers, AIMS Ireland, La Leche League, Home Birth Association. Impact of change on the family i.e. pregnancy and childbirth; Social Perspectives; Reflection skills; Negotiation skills.

The essence of this unit of study is for the student to gain an understanding of pregnancy and childbirth through the eyes of the woman. The relationship will include antenatal and postnatal visits and attendance at the birth if this is appropriate and welcomed by the woman. With assistance from midwives in the antenatal clinic and midwifery led services, the student will be facilitated to meet with a woman, who is willing to share her experiences and who is not already known by the student. The accomplishment of the remainder of the requirements of the module is the responsibility of the student. Regular meetings with midwife lecturers will provide a venue for discussion and reflection.

Research and study into salient aspects of the woman’s issues is required. The sources of knowledge that the student accesses to help give ‘meaning’ to these activities must be documented (these will also need to be evident in the log of meetings recorded by the student). This process of reflection and recording is a valuable part of the learning experience of this module and will also help in the preparation for the assessment of the unit of learning. Relevant references will be included.

Reflection is actively facilitated in a series of ten days (136 hours) over the students' final internship period. These reflective practice facilitation sessions enable participants to independently support reflective practice amongst their peers. The sessions also expose the students to the principles of clinical midwifery supervision. Each day consists of two hours of student peer support of reflective practice. One and a half hours of facilitated group workshops using either hospital case-notes, or art and drama exercises, provide a stimulus to reflection on practice issues. Three further hours of modelled clinical supervision complete the structured element of the reflective days. All of these sessions are supported or facilitated by experienced midwife practitioners from the practice area and midwife lecturers. The remaining hours allow the student to avail of local and university library facilities for the preparation of a reflective portfolio that will provide documentary evidence of each individual's personal and professional development over the internship period. The portfolio will thus be available for the students to bring to potential employers as evidence of their continuing professional development and reflective practice.

In (1) we examine the variety of societal responses to deafness over time. We begin with references to deafness and Deaf people in ancient times and trace changing attitudes to deafness, signed languages and Deafhood up until contemporary times. We also explore the notion of Deaf culture and community and consider the objective symbols and behavioural norms of this culture. 

This module introduces a continuum of perspectives of deafness, and examines the range of practical and political implications of these views. We also consider the range of implications that this can have on a Deaf person’s self-image. A range of views from Deaf deafened and hard of hearing people which have been pre-recorded are shared over the course of this module. This module also considers different ways of being Deaf in the modern world.

MLO-06 Demonstrate evidence of knowledge and skills in assertive communication skills and their application within a work context.
Module Learning Aims:
Rationale and Aims
Therapeutic engagement skills are essential for all helping relationships in mental health practice. The knowledge and interpersonal skills that practitioners use to communicate are essential aspects of helping the person, while at the same time facilitating the development of a positive therapeutic relationship. For the practitioner, this requires the use of a range of appropriate and effective communication and engagement skills. Practitioners have an ongoing responsibility to be person-centred, self-aware, informed and skilled in their use of effective communication and engagement skills with individuals affected by mental health problems, their carers and other key people involved in their care. This module aims to build on participants’ knowledge and application of interpersonal skills, and to provide them with a focused guide to specific communication skills and interventions that assists practitioners to understand and respond more skilfully and effectively to people across the lifespan recovering from mental health problems in different settings. Emphasis will be placed on the importance of applying theory to inform therapeutic skills and interventions. The module will also examine attitudes and responses towards people affected by mental health problems and examine how they impact on building, maintaining and sustaining therapeutic relationships in a range of settings.

Module Learning Aims:
In Ireland, some form of an eating disorder affects approximately 200,000 people, with 400 hundred new cases presenting each year (DoHC 2006). Care, treatment and recovery from an eating disorder are often associated with a relapsing and remitting trajectory. Working with people affected by eating disorders is a complex endeavour for all concerned however, little information or training is available, which enables health care workers to understand and respond more skilfully and effectively to people across the lifespan affected by eating disorders. Increased knowledge can improve health care workers’ early detection of eating disorders.

The aim of this module is to provide participants with a holistic exploration of eating disorders and to equip participants with the core knowledge and skills to identify, manage and engage therapeutically with people across the lifespan recovering from an eating disorder. The module will also examine the responses and attitudes towards people affected by eating disorders and examine how it affects building, maintaining and sustaining a supportive working relationship with the person in a range of settings.

Module Learning Aims:
One in ten young people in Ireland suffer from mental health problems. 75% of adults with mental health problems exhibit symptoms before the age of 16. One in five of these young people will come in contact with a mental health service. Community CAFMHS teams are made up of inter-disciplinary teams with many different perspectives/schools of thought. 

The aim of this module is to introduce the learner to a collection of perspectives and make them a critical consumer of CAFMH approaches. According to the Vision of Change (2006), CAHMS need to have a collection of competencies and double in numbers to meet population need. This module will provide the student a robust theoretical understanding coupled with the practical application of this knowledge. This module provides the student with an opportunity to critique theoretical understandings that underpin the assessment care and treatment of mental distress in children and young people. The module explores and critiques theories in the context of common ‘diagnostic categories’ and their utility, relevance and supplication to the contemporary child and adolescent world, referring to the technological evolution, cyber psychology and current childhood narratives.

Module Learning Aims:
This module introduces students to the range of ways in which deafness and Deaf people are categorised – by medical personnel, by hearing people, and by the Deaf community. Three major strands are covered: (1) Perspectives on Deafness: The Deaf Community, Culture and Historical Context (2) Medical, Social and Personal and (3) International Perspectives on Deafness. 

In (1) we examine the variety of societal responses to deafness over time. We begin with references to deafness and Deaf people in ancient times and trace changing attitudes to deafness, signed languages and Deafhood up until contemporary times. We also explore the notion of Deaf culture and community and consider the objective symbols and behavioural norms of this culture. 

This module introduces a continuum of perspectives of deafness, and examines the range of practical and political implications of these views. We also consider the range of implications that this can have on a Deaf person’s self-image. A range of views from Deaf deafened and hard of hearing people which have been pre-recorded are shared over the course of this module. This module also considers different ways of being Deaf in the modern world.
