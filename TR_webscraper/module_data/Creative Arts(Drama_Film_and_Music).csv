Module Learning Aims:
This is the second module of a three-part cycle designed to equip students with the skills of the theatre director. After six weeks of laboratory classes exploring aspects of the directing process through problem-based learning students will prepare an individual project. This course aims to provide a fundamental grounding for directors from which they can go on to engage with different approaches and theories of directing.

 
Module Content:
Available 2012/2013 This module has three phrases: a large group project on Shakespeare texts linked with Advanced Design courses numerous small problem-based assignments in class and the twenty-minute scene from a text of the student’s own choosing (presented in Week 10 of the module) subject to approval by the course lecturer. Throughout the module students should be prepared to present work and to comment critically upon each other’s work. Each workshop session is designed to bring students into contact with at least one practical challenge or conceptual problem of directing preparing students to navigate imposed difficulties or restrictions in the live theatre. The teaching approach will thus be problem-based in which students must work in both group and solo contexts to resolve imposed obstacles and meet an objective. Outside reading research rehearsal and meetings will be required in addition to the two hours of weekly class. The classes will augment work done in Principles of Directing by bringing in elements of design and building interpersonal communication skills with actors and collaborators

Module Learning Aims:
This is a studio module in the establishment of a personal acting technique primarily as regards exploration and rehearsal of dramatic text toward a present and crafted performance. Each student works toward the self-driven rehearsal and performance of a series of scenes and monologues. 

 
Module Content:
This module is a workshop-based acting class for which vital learning takes place in the studio. As a result full attendance and unflagging commitment are essential. At the same time there is a strong emphasis on the actor’s responsibility to work outside class. Although theoretical texts about acting will be referred to along the way there are no formal reading assignments aside from plays – constant reflection and analysis is encouraged through regular class discussion and written engagement. The module begins with a series of exercises improvisations and assignments designed to instil a sense of spontaneous engagement and simple truth to behaviour under fictional circumstances. In a beginning round of scene work students are led through the process of reading a text as an actor plumbing and exploring the text through a two-pronged attention to organic behaviour and rooted readable performance. While students receive personal attention and insight into the actor’s toolbox throughout the process they are also expected to take personal responsibility for the scene’s growth rehearsing without supervision and putting in work outside of class. A written assignment in the form of a log-like reflection on practice and process is due at the end of each semester. Attention will also be given to the use of voice and body in the rehearsal process. Students are required to take both semesters of the module but those who demonstrate insufficient commitment face exclusion after the first semester.

Students will read and discuss set works of dramatic theory and dramatic texts. They will read and then see a play in performance. They will complete an essay and six short writing exercises.

Semester two: 

Students will read each other's work in class and learn the methodology of play workshops.

Students meet once a week for two hours over two semesters. Students will be allocated reading in advance of each workshop for discussion in class in the first semester. During this semester students will also be required to complete one 1500 word essay on dramatic theory from an assigned text or on an assigned play and six short dramatic writing exercises. Some of these will also be read in class for discussion. In the second semester excerpts from the students’ own plays in progress will be read by the class each week and then discussed. The emphasis in the second semester is on hearing work and developing the ability to critique what is heard in a constructive way. The student can then learn to internalise this process to help with their own writing.

Module Learning Aims:
This module follows on from the Acting module to engrain and build upon rehearsal philosophies for the approach of more challenging historical texts. It is a studio module in the advanced cultivation of a personal acting technique primarily as regards exploration and rehearsal of dramatic text toward a present and crafted performance. The demands on the student increase at this level to include research and analysis as well as more difficult and diverse material. Class meets for two hours per week with students obliged to undertake the bulk of rehearsal (two to four hours) outside formal class time.

 
Module Content:
This module is a workshop-based acting class for which vital learning takes place in the studio. As a result full attendance and unflagging commitment are essential. At the same time there is a strong emphasis on the actor’s responsibility to think research and rehearse outside of class. There are no formal reading assignments aside from chosen plays – but a far greater emphasis will be placed on work done outside class including rehearsal research and analytical engagement. A failure to give suitable priority to the demands of the module during first semester may result in exclusion for the second semester. Advanced exercises and games will be used to further stretch the performer’s senses of organic connection and spontaneity however the focus of the module remains upon the process of rehearsal. Further attention will be given to the technical demands of voice and body with increasing responsibility placed upon the student to develop an awareness of the instrument its capabilities and obligations. Increased focus will be placed on the performer’s responsibility to research text and reflect upon process.

 
Class work over two semesters will focus on a succession of scenes addressing the stylistic demands of tragedy comedy and their various historical permutations as well as Shakespearean verse and monologue/soliloquy

MU3431,Recital A,Martin Adams,"Learning Outcomes:
Students who successfully complete this module will have demonstrated that:
they can perform to a standard equivalent to that of a conservatory diploma in teaching or performance
that they can develop a balanced concert programme of the specified length
that they can choose and use printed editions in a critical and informed way
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
To be decided in conjunction with the module coordinator. As instrumental tuition is provided by extramural teachers of the student's choice the department seeks to provide a mode of assessment similar to that of a conservatoire's external diploma examinations. The student should ensure that his/her teacher is qualified to teach to the required level which is that of a diploma in teaching or performance on the instrument concerned. At all times the assessment process is guided by close liaison with the student and the instrumental teacher. Before any student is admitted to the recital option a testimonial of eligibility will be required from the teacher. The testimonial will consist of a form letter that the teacher will sign to confirm eligibility and the number of lessons that the student is expected to receive. In order to assess eligibility all students will be required in the preceding Trinity Term to perform music lasting around 5'7 minutes before the performance coordinator and another member of the Music Department. The decision of the Music Department about eligibility is final.
