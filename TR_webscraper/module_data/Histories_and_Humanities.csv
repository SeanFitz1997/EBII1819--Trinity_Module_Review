·    Familiarity with recent critical approaches to epistolarity in general and to the prescribed text
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
To write a letter - whether a formal public composition or a private letter to a friend - is to create an image consciously or unconsciously of oneself as writer and of one's relationship with the letter's recipient. This was just as true for Roman letter-writers as it is for us today. This module will involve close study of two very different sets of letters a fictional verse text (the Heroides of Ovid) and a collection of 'real' prose letters those of Pliny the younger. Though very different in character these two works raise many similar issues particularly in relation to the letter-writer's self-presentation; further shared themes include relations between the public and the private sphere between literature and life and between men and women. The reading classes will be used for close literary and linguistic analysis of the prescribed (Latin) texts while the weekly lectures will examine more general themes and set the Heroides and the letters of Pliny in a broader context involving the study (in translation) of select letters of Cicero and Seneca and the Epistles of Horace. Taken together these varied texts offer a fascinating window onto the thought-world of writers and readers from the first century BC to the second century AD.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
To write a letter - whether a formal public composition or a private letter to a friend - is to create an image consciously or unconsciously of oneself as writer and of one's relationship with the letter's recipient. This was just as true for Roman letter-writers as it is for us today. This course will explore a selection of the wide range of letters that have survived from Roman antiquity from the highly personal correspondence of Cicero to the self-consciously artful letters of Pliny the Younger. We will also look at the fictional letters of Ovid the Heroides (Letters of Heroines) which take the form of first-person compositions sent by the heroines of myth to their lovers. Taken together these varied texts offer a fascinating window onto the thought-world of writers and readers from the first century BC to the second century AD and prompt reflexion on such issues as self-representation and political 'spin'; on the relationship between the public and private spheres; and on male and female 'voices' in Roman literature.

Didactic (or ‘teaching’) poetry was a long-lived genre that flourished intermittently from the archaic period to late antiquity. In some cases engaging with profound philosophical issues such as the nature of reality and the purpose of human life in others combining a playful display of erudition with literary social and political criticism these fascinating and sometimes perplexing poems repay close and detailed study and discussion. This module will consider three rather different but mutually engaged examples from the late Republican and Augustan periods the De Rerum Natura of Lucretius the Georgics of Virgil and the Ars Amatoria of Ovid. Each of the three works will be studied independently but we will also focus on areas of overlap and common themes shared between the three. Topics for individual classes will include the relationship between didactic poetry and technical prose; poetic models and poetic technique; religion and myth; humans and animals; love and sexuality; parody in the Ars Amatoria; and the – in various ways problematic – endings of the three poems.

Ability to recognise and analyse ‘oral’ features in written texts

Ability to translate and analyse the primary texts in context

Ability to engage critically with scholarly literature

Critical thinking and ability to present a coherent argument in oral presentations and written assignments
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module focuses on practices of speaking and writing in Latin at the periphery and beyond the boundaries of élite culture and of canonical literature. Classical Latin has been codified through authoritative literary models; but was the written language of Cicero the Latin that everyone (including Cicero himself) spoke in ordinary conversation? Was the written language of Cicero the standard against which correctness and acceptability were measured in antiquity? Did Latin change over time and how? How did Latin established itself to the detriment (and often the death) of minority languages in the Italian peninsula? Did Latin ever undergo a process of standardisation? What is the relationship between colloquial and literary language? 
This course explore these and related questions with a focus on the informal registers of Latin -- namely the varieties corresponding to the spoken language of the literate the semi-literate and the illiterate -- and the methodologies employed in extracting information on the matter from written sources. Primary texts for the course will be literary authors who engaged with mimicking lower registers (the language of freedmen in Petronius' Cena Trimalchionis; select epigrams of Martial) and non-literary texts such as informal letters and curse tablets Pompeian graffiti and verse inscriptions from both centre and periphery of the Roman empire. 
While being anchored on textual evidence this course has a large theoretical component and requires serious engagement with recent scholarship. You will familiarise with the concept of linguistic register and appreciate the importance of context in oral and written communication. You will also learn about substandard features of Latin (‘errors’ usage and effects of this type of Latin on modern languages). You will enjoy this course if you wish to expand your understanding of Latin and thinking about the ways in which language works in context.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This course explores the nature of entertainment and spectacle in the Greek and Roman worlds and aims to set it within a historical cultural and social framework. Entertainment is a fundamental feature of our modern society but how did it work in the Greek and Roman periods? Was it 'fun' or were there other important factors in play? In this course we shall explore the nature context and social importance of the different forms of public entertainment and spectacle in the Greek and Roman worlds and examine how and why such displays changed in significance over time.
The course primarily takes an archaeological approach and there will be close study of the physical evidence. Textual and epigraphic sources will be integrated so that a broad perspective can be appreciated. On a more light-hearted note by the end of this course you should also be able to spot the mistakes in films such as Gladiator Spartacus and Ben Hur!

Apart from contemporary approaches to verbal communication such as sociolinguistics we shall investigate classical rhetorical techniques and terminology including criteria for artful arrangement of words sound effects figurative language and concepts such as allusiveness acceptability accommodation politeness and humour. Some of the questions raised are: What is the relation between spoken and literary language? What is the relation between rhetoric philosophy and politics?

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The Hellenistic period stretching from the death of Alexander the Great in 323BC to the death of Cleopatra VII of Egypt in 30BC is marked by the rapid expansion of Macedonian power across the ancient world from Macedon and Greece to Egypt the Black Sea Afghanistan and even India. Nonetheless its core remained the old Greek world of the Aegean and the western Mediterranean. A defining feature of this world is the interaction between the established Greek city-states and the new Macedonian monarchies. This module will study from a number of different angles the nature of the relationship between kings and cities in the Hellenistic period. Epigraphic evidence namely royal letters and civic decrees will be of primary importance but emphasis will also be placed throughout on literary numismatic and archaeological material. The rise of these Hellenistic kingdoms has been seen by many scholars to mark the death of the Greek city-state – monarchic power triumphing over civic independence – but this module will explore the development of what was a unique vibrant yet sometimes tense relationship between the old Greek cities and the new Macedonian kings one that integrated cities and kings civic independence and royal authority Greek past and Macedonian present. Topics for discussion will include: the Greek polis; Macedonian kingship; freedom and democracy; royal civic foundations; Hellenism; ruler cult; image and ideology; royal and civic economies; court society.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Didactic (or ‘teaching’) poetry was a long-lived genre that flourished intermittently from the archaic period to late antiquity. In some cases engaging with profound philosophical issues such as the nature of reality and the purpose of human life in others combining a playful display of erudition with literary social and political criticism these fascinating and sometimes perplexing poems repay close and detailed study and discussion. This module will consider three rather different but mutually engaged examples from the late Republican and Augustan periods the De Rerum Natura of Lucretius the Georgics of Virgil and the Ars Amatoria of Ovid. Each of the three works will be studied independently but we will also focus on areas of overlap and common themes shared between the three. Topics for individual classes will include the relationship between didactic poetry and technical prose; poetic models and poetic technique; religion and myth; humans and animals; love and sexuality; parody in the Ars Amatoria; and the – in various ways problematic – endings of the three poems.

Ability to recognise and analyse ‘oral’ features in written texts

Ability to translate and analyse the primary texts in context

Ability to engage critically with scholarly literature

Critical thinking and ability to present a coherent argument in oral presentations and written assignments
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module focuses on practices of speaking and writing in Latin at the periphery and beyond the boundaries of élite culture and of canonical literature. Classical Latin has been codified through authoritative literary models; but was the written language of Cicero the Latin that everyone (including Cicero himself) spoke in ordinary conversation? Was the written language of Cicero the standard against which correctness and acceptability were measured in antiquity? Did Latin change over time and how? How did Latin established itself to the detriment (and often the death) of minority languages in the Italian peninsula? Did Latin ever undergo a process of standardisation? What is the relationship between colloquial and literary language? 
This course explore these and related questions with a focus on the informal registers of Latin -- namely the varieties corresponding to the spoken language of the literate the semi-literate and the illiterate -- and the methodologies employed in extracting information on the matter from written sources. Primary texts for the course will be literary authors who engaged with mimicking lower registers (the language of freedmen in Petronius' Cena Trimalchionis; select epigrams of Martial) and non-literary texts such as informal letters and curse tablets Pompeian graffiti and verse inscriptions from both centre and periphery of the Roman empire. 
While being anchored on textual evidence this course has a large theoretical component and requires serious engagement with recent scholarship. You will familiarise with the concept of linguistic register and appreciate the importance of context in oral and written communication. You will also learn about substandard features of Latin (‘errors’ usage and effects of this type of Latin on modern languages). You will enjoy this course if you wish to expand your understanding of Latin and thinking about the ways in which language works in context.

Module Content:
This course examines some of the key intellectual figures that challenged traditional values and received wisdom in Athens during the late fifth century BC and traces the popular reception of their ideas against the backdrop of the events of the last decades of the fifth century. It aims to provide students with a broad survey of the main themes of sophistic debate and to present them as a crucial intellectual context for our understanding both of our major literary sources for this period and of the social and political phenomena to which they allude. From those writers who vilified the new intellectuals to those who exploited the issues that they raised receptions of the sophists during the late fifth century were made in dialogue with the political events of Athens' history. By exploring that dialogue this course situates key works of Greek literature in their crucial intellectual context and considers how intellectual trends and political history may elaborate each other.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module will explore the importance of genre theory for the study of Augustan poetry and the ramifications of generic choices with particular reference to the representation and discourses of gender in Augustan Rome. Recent scholarship on Latin poetry suggests that genre is far from constituting a purely formal academic system for the classification of literary texts; rather generic conventions and hierarchies offer a field for the expression and exploration of cultural and political values. Close reading of poetic texts from a range of genres will form the basis for an exploration of models of masculinity and femininity in Augustan Rome.

How did the Greeks view non-Greek cultures? Similarly how did those cultures in their turn view Greeks? Was the interaction between Greeks and non-Greeks simply one of conflict? Were non-Greeks just uncultured barbarians? This module will explore the long tradition of cross-cultural interaction between Greeks and non-Greek ‘barbarians’ from Homer to the Hellenistic period. It will trace the numerous mythological historical religious and economic connections that underlined relations between Greek and barbarians. Questions of identity and ethnicity will be raised throughout and focus will continually placed on the means by which Greek identity was simultaneously enforced by yet adaptive to engagement with non-Greek ‘barbarians’. The seminars within this module will draw upon a wide variety of literary archaeological numismatic art-historical epigraphic and papyrological sources.

The dominant patterns and typologies of western European architecture in the early modern period originate in Italy in the fifteenth century. In the cities and courts of central and northern Italy a virtual laboratory of architectural form generated new typologies of domestic civic and ecclesiastical architecture. In particular the development of domestic or residential design as a subject of focused architectural endeavour reflects the increasing secularisation of European society. This module aims to introduce students to the formal characteristics of architecture in the period 1400-1700 to examine the relationship of function form and patronage in architectural design and to consider in particular the development of the villa and palace form.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Medieval cathedrals and churches are numbered amongst the great monuments of European culture. However modern visitors have a very different experience to that of their medieval predecessors as they encounter these buildings stripped of their treasures and often in a fragmentary state. This module will consider the medieval church as a Gesamtkunstwerk (or total work of art). It will address the surviving architecture sculpture wall-painting stained-glass metalwork and manuscripts associated with medieval churches to try to reconstruct the original appearance of these buildings. In doing so the module will explore questions of making function and meaning. It will also consider the roles of patrons artists and critics in determining what was appropriate for the house of God. Taking the period c.1100-1220 and the region of modern France as its focus the module will address the major stylistic change that occurred with the development of the Gothic style and question what this meant for religious art and architecture. Attendance at all lectures and seminars is compulsory.

This programme will provide a structure in terms of the movements and visual strategies identified with modernism such as Cubism Primitivism Expressionism Dada Surrealism (and others) but also the key themes and issues that were significant across these movements. Art and Modernism will address the ground-breaking contributions of some of the leading figures including Picasso Matisse Munch Kandinsky Duchamp Malevich Dali and Pollock. The means of visual communication – through experiment with colour form materials and forums for exhibition – were fundamental to the challenges they posed not just to traditions of visual expression but to the very society within which they functioned.

It also explores the role of collectors and museums and their place in contemporary society investigating also the meanings that can be attributed to objects. Aspects of curiosity and colonialism in the museum setting are touched upon as well as matters of authenticity conservation and display. The module introduces students to the work of specialists in a variety of cultural institutions located in Dublin and to the problems which specialists in these institutions encounter and resolve. The institutions will include the National Library the Chester Beatty Library the Dublin City Library and the National Archives.
The internship in the Hilary term introduces students to practical work experience as encountered by specialists in one of the partner institutions. Each student will spend 22 hours under the direction of a professional curator librarian or archivist in one of the nominated cultural institutions working on a pre-agreed project. This person will serve as the student's mentor for the duration of the student's internship and will oversee the practical work that the student undertakes The student may be expected to work as part of a small team or to undertake independent work. Each internship will also have a nominated TCD advisor to deal with potential disputes between student and external mentor as well as provide the academic framework for the internship project (in consultation with the external mentor). The assessment of these projects will be the responsibility of the TCD advisor.

HI1101,Doing History,Co-ordinatorGrace O’Keeffe,"Learning Outcomes:
 On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

Understand the difference between primary and secondary sources and between difference kinds of primary sources (narrative sources record sources maps visual art archaeological artefacts architectural heritage etc) and be able to use them

Understand how to make effective use of the history resources of Trinity College Library

Understand how to cite books and articles in footnotes and in a bibliography


 
Module Learning Aims:
The aim of this module is to introduce students to a variety of different types of sources used by professional historians.

 
Module Content:
This module will introduce you to the sources that historians use in trying to reconstruct the past. These ‘primary’ sources include written documents and you will work with a variety of texts – from official archives to legal documents and from personal memoirs to annals and chronicles. But historians also use other sources – for example archaeological remains and our architectural heritage and visual art and literature – and you will learn how they can help us to fill in the picture. You will also get the opportunity to engage with these sources in some of the great national repositories located on our doorstep such as Trinity’s own Long Room Ireland’s National Museum National Gallery National Library and National Archives.

When historians use these primary sources to piece together the past they produce ‘secondary’ sources – the books and articles with which you are already familiar. But these are not ‘the truth’. They are a version of the past as interpreted by men and women who no matter how hard they try cannot but be affected by their own experiences and preconceptions. And so this module will also introduce you to some central issues in historiography – the writing of history – in order to enrich your experience in the reading of history throughout your Trinity years.

We explore how Irish society and kingship changed in the aftermath of Clontarf as a result of inter-provincial warfare and the changing role of the church. The second half of the module examines the causes and implications of the English (or Anglo-Norman) invasion of the late 1160s perhaps the single most formative development in Irish secular affairs. We study the interaction of cultures in its aftermath and the Irish opposition to English rule that saw the emergence of England’s ongoing Irish problem through later centuries. The module closes with the most serious challenge to English power in medieval Ireland: the Scottish invasion (1315-18) led by Edward Bruce brother of Robert Bruce king of Scots.

Module Learning Aims:
The aim of this module is to explore key developments on twentieth-century Irish history.
Module Content:
This module examines Ireland's twentieth century. From one country under the Union to two independent states this module will analyse the political changes that shaped the century from Home Rule and Unionism to revolution to independence from dominion to republic from self-rule to direct rule from `ourselves alone' to the EEC from troubles to peace. It will question the emphasis on the political narrative which has dominated the study of the century and will consider how the priorities of social economic and cultural history raise significant challenges for the traditional studies of twentieth century Ireland. Drawing on a wide range of sources and experiences this module will explore the forces that have shaped Ireland's twentieth century the extent to which events in the second half of the century have shaped the analysis and debate of the first fifty years. By placing Ireland's twentieth century in a broader context it will also consider how the Irish case compares to the experience of other states. It will question how Ireland's twentieth century has been studied how the emphasis of the historiography is changing or can change and whether comparative analysis can confirm or undermine conclusions about the Irish case.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Global integration is not only a fact of modern life but of modern history writing. The interconnectedness of distant societies and states and powerful forces making for social cultural and economic interaction have prompted significant scholarly assessment. This module investigates some of the events and processes which have led to a more integrated world order between the mid-nineteenth century and the later twentieth century. For most of that period much of the world was carved up between a number of inter-continental empires centred in Europe. How those empires grew exerted control and in due course retreated will be the particular focus of the module. But other processes too will be considered not least the integrating force of economic changes and the spreading power of capitalism across the globe. Attention will be given to the evolution of ideologies of imperialism and social Darwinism and to whether or not such ideologies impacted upon changing global power relationships. The module is designed on a comparative model though course reading will be provided in English and while broadly chronological in approach will focus on a wide range of themes in cultural economic and political history.

What do we mean by modern Ireland? Where is modern Ireland and when did it begin? Having broached these questions this course will investigate what life was like on the island of Ireland across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Reflecting the increased focus on social and cultural themes in Irish historiography this course will address the ways in which historians are tackling a broad range of societal questions. What characterised peoples’ family working and social lives? How did people interact with the apparatus of the state and of religious bodies? How did the evolution of media affect daily life? What forces and ideas shaped the provision of education and welfare? What impact did emigration have on both host and home societies? Key to the course is an understanding of what differentiated experiences; how did gender class geography and moral/status hierarchies of different kinds shape individual lives.

It explores the reconstruction and recovery of Europe after 1945 - both as a divided continent during the Cold War and in light of moves towards and challenges to European solidarity and unity. Furthermore it considers shifting conceptions and geopolitical configurations of a continent in flux as well as the global dimensions of European history throughout the century. While some sessions will focus on particular European nations others will focus on key events or themes in comparative and transnational perspectives. The module thus provides an overall view of the history of modern Europe since the early 20th century and of the foundations of contemporary Europe.

·    Complete analytical reviews of both historical fiction and film

·    Undertake a comparative assessment of historical representation in film and/or fiction

·    Demonstrate an understanding of some key questions relating to the imagining of history in fictional works
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Most people most of the time never encounter the past through academic history books. Instead the past confronts them in images and interpretations that appear everywhere from museums to advertisements movies to monuments. The imagining of history is such a prominent trend in popular culture that students need to be equipped to deconstruct representations of the past and to interrogate their own working assumptions about history imbibed from film and literature. This module explores three examples of how historical events and themes have been imagined in the world outside of professional historical scholarship. Students will examine how these subjects have been ‘brought to life’ in film and literature. Students will also have the opportunity to consider wider questions and problems which link together the three subjects addressed in the module. This is not a module designed to test the accuracy in a narrow sense of ‘historical fiction’ in literature and film. The aim is rather to enable students to examine the ways in which the past has been presented interpreted and re-interpreted in various genres; to uncover the assumptions or agendas that shaped creative decisions and the responses of audiences to genuinely popular representations of the past; and to reflect critically upon the qualities that make for a great work of historical imagination or reconstruction qualities which cannot easily be replicated by the conventional methods of historical inquiry.

theoretical challenges to the status and value of history writing
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module’s aim is to provide students with a survey of the some of the principal movements and debates which have shaped modern historical research and writing. Students will be introduced to major conceptual and methodological approaches and some of the problems which confront historians in their everyday work and will be given the opportunity to examine some of the classic texts of modern historical writing.

 
Historical construction takes place in several stages from the initial selection and examination of sources to the production of a final interpretation . And each of these stages raises its own methodological and philosophical problems

·   What sources should the historian use?

·   What sort of evidence is convincing?

·   Which documents should be read and how many?

·   How are previous interpretations and perspectives to be weighed ?

·   Which interpretative concepts work best ?

·   Which subjects are worth investigating in the first place and on what ground is this selection and that approach based?

·   Can history writing be objective?

·   Should the writer even try to be free of value judgement?

·   Can historians erase their own assumptions social attitudes and prejudices before beginning this series of intricate tasks? Or should they frankly declare them and use them overtly in their historical interpretations and arguments?

It is to explore such questions about how historians have tried to write history that this module has been designed. By introducing students to the wide variety of perspectives methods and concepts by which historians have actually approached the task of making sense of the past it seeks to provide practical and usable answers to the theoretical problems inherent in History as a form of knowledge

What characterised peoples’ family working and social lives? How did people interact with the apparatus of the state and of religious bodies? How did the evolution of media affect daily life? What forces and ideas shaped the provision of education and welfare? What impact did emigration have on both host and home societies? Key to the course is an understanding of what differentiated experiences; how did gender class geography and moral/status hierarchies of different kinds shape individual lives. It will also place the social history of Ireland in comparative and global contexts in order to question ideas of Irish insularity and exceptionalism.

Module Content:
Between the death of Henry VIII and the death of Elizabeth I England underwent a series of profound social political and cultural developments. An underdeveloped country on the verge of crisis was transformed into one of Europe's most expanding economies. A fragile monarchy on an off-shore island became one of the greatest powers in international relations and one of the furthest cultural backwaters of Europe became the seat of the last flowering of the Renaissance. Such massive changes came accompanied by equally great and complex problems. Economic development widened social divisions and sharpened social conflict. Religious Reformation affirmed national unity but provoked widespread dissent and England's emergence as a principal defender of Protestantism forced it into increasing conflict with the other great European power of the sixteenth century Hapsburg Spain. It was in this context that the extraordinary intellectual and literary flowering of the later sixteenth century took place. This module aims to set the Elizabethan Renaissance amidst these broader social political and ideological developments and to examine its principal achievements in poetry prose and drama in relation to the massive body of political commentaries social polemics religious exhortations histories and stories engravings maps and emblem books through which the Elizabethans as a whole attempted to comprehend and control their changing world.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module explores the political social economic and cultural life of the first two decades of Irish independence. From the Anglo-Irish Treaty to the end of the Second World War this course examines the expectations and the realities of freedom. It revolves around a central question posed by W.T. Cosgrave in February 1931 but still apposite and challenging to any interpretation of these years: ‘what has the average man in the street got out of his independence and self-government?’ It is the purpose of this module to encourage students to explore the range and variety of possible answers and to prompt them to ask a whole series of questions of their own. The module also concentrates on a number of the questions that have been emerging in the recent historiography of this period. Was there a counter-revolution in the first years of the state? To what extent had there been a revolution at all? What were the consequences of the years of violence and the effects of the civil war on the political culture that followed? Did independent Ireland become indelibly shaped by the nature of its foundation? What defined relations with the Northern State? What did people aspire to and what were they afraid of? Popular politics and dissent in the state from Sinn Féin to the army mutineers to the Blueshirts and beyond will be looked at through the prism of these and other questions.

This module draws on a wide variety of primary source materials and a range of sources are provided for seminars each week. However from government files to cabinet minutes from private papers to Oireachtas debates from films and novels and women’s magazines from jazz records to diocesan archives and anything and everything in between students are expected to conduct their own primary research in the various archival repositories in Dublin.

The aim of this module is to conduct an intensive study of the French Revolution especially through the medium of primary sources.
Module Content:
Even after two centuries of debate the French Revolution still remains one of the most passionately contested and intellectually creative areas of historical enquiry. Why did it take place? What was the nature of the new régime that emerged in 1789 why did it become so much more radical in the years that followed and how did that process change the lives of ordinary French men and women? Why ultimately did the Revolution lead to Terror and end in dictatorship? In this module students will be encouraged to address these and other questions by examining different interpretations of the Revolution and through their own research in primary sources. While a selection of core documents will be supplied in translation students will also be expected to undertake their own research in the extensive collections of prints pamphlets and periodicals that are available in various libraries across Dublin and on the internet.

Module Learning Aims:
 The aim of this module is to conduct an intensive study of Reformed religion in the sixteenth century especially through the medium of primary sources.
Module Content:
This module examines the impact of ideas about religious reform on sixteenth-century politics society and culture. It seeks to understand how the Reformation changed European societies by examining the development of Reformed religion between 1540 and 1600. Classes look at the key ideas of Calvinism its Genevan origins and its spread across the Continent. Using a range of contemporary texts this module analyses the impact of ideas which lay at the heart of this movement about God politics and morality. Did Calvinists think that they alone were predestined to go to heaven? Calvinists often took part in rebellions against royal power but is an image of Calvinist republicanism justified? Why and how did Calvinists try to tame European society; to stop people swearing in Hungary ban dancing in France and curb excessive drinking in Dutch towns? This module will consider whether indeed Calvinism produced a new sort of European citizen dedicated to hard work and personal discipline thereby promoting the spirit of modern capitalism.

Module Content:
This module is designed to introduce students to the history of the First World War in Germany and Italy. It will cover military events and the home front including politics economics society and culture. While sufficient attention will be paid to major developments in Germany’s war with the western powers it will go beyond the familiar focus on the western front and enable students to study less well-known aspects such as Germany on the eastern front (Russia) and the war in the Alps between Italy and Austria-Hungary and Germany. The topics may include: the immediate causes of the war in the July crisis; Italy’s intervention; the problems of ‘national mobilization’ and war enthusiasm; agriculture and industry; intellectuals; propaganda; strategy and war aims; major battles and operations; trench warfare and the war of movement on three fronts; troop morale and combat effectiveness; military innovation; hunger blockade food production; crisis breakdown and recovery in Italy; crisis collapse and defeat in Germany; the memory of the war. A knowledge of German and/or Italian although not essential would be an advantage. Please note that the study of Britain France or other powers is not a part of this module; long-term causes and long-term consequences of the war (e.g. the rise of fascism) are likewise beyond our remit.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Was there a ‘global’ Middle Ages? In an effort to answer this question this module ranges far outside the conventional geographical confines of medieval scholarship to explore hemispheric interactions across Eurasia in the age of the Black Death. The opening weeks of the module explore what European armchair travellers thought they knew of the ‘outer world’ in the Middle Ages including their belief in monstrous races. We also encounter the largest land empire the world has ever known — the Mongol empire — through the writings of Europeans who travelled to the East during the era of the so-called Pax Mongolica. In later weeks the perspective shifts to the experience of non-Europeans whose itineraries and breadth of cultural knowledge far outstripped that of their European counterparts. To give but one example: the journeys of Marco Polo — which rapidly passed into legend in Europe — were surpassed by his near-contemporary the intrepid Muslim scholar Ibn Baṭṭūṭa (d.1368/9) who travelled across the Sahara to the Malian empire and its recently-annexed outpost at Timbuktu. Following Ibn Baṭṭūṭa and other travellers we embark on a grand tour of the major world civilizations and cultures and examine the political upheavals that engulfed the hemisphere after the outbreak of the Black Death. In the final weeks we follow the astonishing voyages of exploration led by the eunuch Admiral Zheng He which were sponsored by the Ming dynasty; and we conclude with the rise and fall of Tamerlane last of the ‘world conquerors’ whose death marked the end of a distinctive phase of world historical development.

These are some of the questions this course will address as we examine the gender roles and identities assigned to men and women from the Renaissance to the French Revolution. A product of the early feminist histories of women gender history now encompasses a wide range of studies including the study of sexuality queer theory and men’s studies. Throughout this course the student will engage with the historiography of these challenging subjects examine the concepts of femininity masculinity patriarchy and gender as they have changed over time and question how much gender as a category of historical analysis has to offer the historian. We will use a wide range of sources from the works of early ‘proto-feminists’ to the latest historiographical writings on the future of the discipline thus highlighting the origins and ongoing relevance of debates on gender rights and relations.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module explores experiences of and attitudes to both violence and the law in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Ireland. It will involve an examination of the extent nature and characteristics of violent activity in Ireland and any changes which have occurred in patterns of violence over time.  The focus will be on both interpersonal and collective violence and will offer students an opportunity to engage with the varying causes and motives for violent activity in Irish society from the directly personal to the overtly political in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. There will be a particular emphasis on the activities of agrarian secret societies that to varying degrees used violence and the threat of violence in order to regulate socio-economic conditions and to enforce ‘popular’ norms in opposition to the official rule of law. There will also be a consideration of particular incidents of public disorder (especially those arising from sectarian division) which arose in Ireland throughout this period. The seminar will also reflect on the impact overseas of such traditional forms of protest and broader patterns of violent activity in Ireland.

The course will also focus on the role of the law and in particular its effectiveness in controlling violent activity in Irish society. It will explore the extent to which developments in policing were related to the state of crime and public disorder in the country and the degree to which they were integral to and bound up in the development of a stronger and more interventionist state over the course of the nineteenth century. There will also be an examination of how the courts operated and their position within Irish culture in the eighteenth- and nineteenth centuries. The consequences of court decisions will be explored through an examination of changes and developments in the nature of punishment over time. Overall the seminar will allow students to garner a greater understanding of both the place and function of violence and the law in Irish society and among those who migrated from it and to place the Irish experience within a broader international context.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The Nineteenth Century marked the high tide of historical writing in Britain’s public culture. By the 1850s the historian as moral philosopher as political scientist as cultural critic and as prophet of the future was everywhere celebrated and large works of history rivalled popular novels on publishers’ bestselling lists. At the same time the study of history once despised in the universities as mere dilletantism was rapidly establishing itself as a respectable academic discipline and by the end of the century the methods of research standards of accuracy forms of publishing and organising institutions of the modern historical profession had been firmly established. By then however a serious divergence had arisen over the nature and purpose of historical research between the free-lance men of letters writing in the market place for a broad popular audience and the university historians burrowing in the archives and writing generally for their peers. And as both groups began to regard each other with increasing incomprehension and contempt the cultural prestige of history and its popularity as a form of knowledge went into decline.

This module seeks to trace the course of History’s history in Britain through a variety of avenues. The careers and works of the great representatives of both schools - Macaulay Carlyle Lecky and Froude on the one side; Stubbs Acton  Maitland and Gardiner on the other – will be examined. The structures and contexts of research teaching and publication will be explored. And a critical analysis of the great themes of the leading historical works – the Norman Conquest the Reformation Cromwell Empire and the running sore of Ireland – will reveal the degree to which contemporary ideological preoccupations influenced supposedly detached historical interpretations.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
In the mid-twentieth century colonialism was still a fact of life for many millions of African and Asian people. The process of decolonization which started after the First World War increased in speed after the Second World War and in the wake of India achieving its independence in 1947. Decolonization shaped the modern world and its legacies are a permanent fixture in contemporary international affairs.

This module will look at the rapid collapse of the British Empire. During our studies we will look at all parts of the British Empire; the ‘White Dominions’ Asia the Middle East Africa and the Caribbean. The main question we will have at the forefront of their minds throughout the year is: how did such a substantial empire decline so rapidly?

The many historiographical arguments about the causes of decolonization will be explored. In so doing the course will cover major aspects of twentieth century world history including: the growth of anti-colonial nationalism the Cold War and the growth of US influence in the post-war world. By delving into aspects of British decolonization the module will although in less detail cover: post-war British politics the shift in focus away from the Commonwealth and towards Europe as well as some aspects of the impact that decolonization had on British society.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The Napoleonic Empire has been seen as the genesis of the French Revolution the betrayal of her Republican experiment the foundation of modern Europe and the precursor to twentieth-century dictatorships. There are elements of truth in all these assessments of an Empire forged through war but maintained through vast legal reform political repression artistic endeavour and social engineering. The Napoleonic Empire to be understood in its entirety has to be approached from a variety of angles and using a range of historical approaches.

This module begins in France on the eve of General Bonaparte’s coup d’état of 18-19 Brumaire year VIII (9-10 November 1799) after ten years of revolution in France. Students will analyse the forces at work from the young general’s return from the occupation of Egypt and creation of a new constitutional regime right up to the fall of his Empire in 1814-15 and beyond. The module will cover subjects as diverse as; the press censorship and propaganda; the arts and sciences; policing and resistance to the state; military campaigns; diplomatic manoeuvring; and political and constitutional change.

The course is divided into three major sections. The first deals with France from Bonaparte’s coup until the establishment of the Empire in 1804. The second covers France and Europe under broad themes of ‘Culture and Society’ and ‘Politics and War’ between 1804 and 1814. The third will consist of the end of the Empire Napoleon’s brief return for ‘100 Days’ the Restoration of the monarchy and the legacies of the period as regards France and Europe.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This semester-long module will examine the cultural geographic political and socio-economic development of Dublin from the Act of Union of 1801 to the 1970s. There is a widespread assumption that after 1801 Dublin declined precipitously from its Georgian heyday. Yet the city also experienced remarkable change and growth as it shifted from being the putative 'second city' of the Empire to a provincial city within the United Kingdom thence to become the capital of an independent Irish state in the twentieth century. James Joyce famously described Dublin as the 'centre of paralysis'; this module will explore the realities dynamic and otherwise of life in Ireland's capital over the past two centuries.

The module is organized around ten incidents themes and texts relating to the history of Dublin from the Act of Union to the 1970s. Topics to be covered include the impact of the Union popular politics the extremes of wealth and poverty that emerged in the Victorian city depictions of Dublin in the work of artists (such as Joyce) the impact of the Irish Revolution on Dublin nightlife and youth culture and perennial tensions between tradition and modernity in a city that sought to reinvent itself in the twentieth century.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The module takes a thematic approach to the impact of Early Christian Ireland (c.AD 400-800) focusing on the co-operation and interaction between the most important churches / churchmen and kings to their mutual advantage. This theme will principally be explored via primary sources generated in the second half of the seventh century by the cults of Patrick Brigit and Colum Cille (Columba). Their cults were so successfully promoted by the churches of Armagh Kildare and Iona in co-operation with particular royal dynasties that those three saints/churches had secured the highest status in the early Irish church by c. 700 with the church of Armagh eventually asserting an overall dominance or primacy. The seventh-century Lives of Patrick Brigit and Colum Cille were sophisticated documents which exploited the new technology of writing introduced by Christianity and addressed a variety of audiences and purposes and were so skilled in doing so that their impact is still discernible today. The Patrick of popular tradition for example is the creation of and testimony to the skills of his seventh-century biographers.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This current centenary period has brought the Irish revolutionary period 1912-23 increasingly into the commemorative spotlight. New sources are still emerging and shaping the way in which we write about and understand this period but controversy and contestation have been part of how this period has been represented from the very outset. This module will chart the evolving interpretations of this period beginning with representations from the period itself and moving on through the various historiographical fictional filmic and popular representations that followed. It will consider the various historiographical influences and political changes that have influenced our understanding of those years along with the effect of the Northern Irish Troubles and the revisionist debates on the portrayal of these years. 

The module will also ask whether the 1912-23 period has been adequately contextualised adequately considered in terms of how revolution is defined whether there has been an overemphasis on violence in the literature or whether this period has come to dominate the narrative of twentieth century Irish history to the exclusion of other themes and issues and how wider international context might change our conception of this period. This module will also address the relationship between the popular history of this period and more academic analysis and consider how the academy has performed when it has entered the fray publically in this field. The module will engage with the gaps between history and commemoration with the official and political interpretations of revolution and how this period has been written into the foundation myths of the two new Irish states.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module offers the chance to study German history through primary sources in translation focusing on the fourteen years of democracy and the first six years of the Nazi dictatorship. The emphasis is on the major themes in political culture such as the legacy of war for a new democratic state the clash between various millenarian ideologies and the role of racism. The Weimar Republic is studied as a period in its own right not as a mere prelude to Nazism. The attempt to mobilize a democratic republican culture was not without success though the tension between democracy and nationalism was one of the factors in the rise of extreme anti-democratic movements. The Nazi regime came to power through mass mobilization and as a result of a gamble by conservative elites; its consolidation in power rested not only on terror and coercion but also on welfare and consent.
