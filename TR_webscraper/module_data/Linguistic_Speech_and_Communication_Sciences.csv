Three major strands are covered: (1) Perspectives on Deafness: The Deaf Community Culture and Historical Context (2) Medical Social and Personal and (3) International Perspectives on Deafness. 

In (1) we examine the variety of societal responses to deafness over time. We begin with references to deafness and Deaf people in ancient times and trace changing attitudes to deafness signed languages and Deafhood up until contemporary times. We also explore the notion of Deaf culture and community and consider the objective symbols and behavioural norms of this culture. 

This module introduces a continuum of perspectives of deafness and examines the range of practical and political implications of these views. We also consider the range of implications that this can have on a Deaf person’s self-image. A range of views from Deaf deafened and hard of hearing people which have been pre-recorded are shared over the course of this module. This module also considers different ways of being Deaf in the modern world.

Module Learning Aims:
The course is designed to establish competence in foundational mathematical concepts used in contemporary cognitive science and computationally-oriented approaches to linguistic theory.
Module Content:
Basic concepts of discrete mathematics are reviewed with attention to their relevance in linguistics: sets operators relations trees logic formal language theory. Emphasis is placed on finite recursive specification of infinite formal languages as an idealization of grammar specification for natural languages (each of which is thought to be infinite but managed by finite brains). Natural languages are modelled as uninterpreted sets of grammatical sentences whose internal structural complexity has implications related to constraints on human syntactic processing. Human languages are also modelled via their translation into logical languages supplied with deductive mechanisms supplying representational and denotational semantic analysis. Logical languages within a range of expressivity classes are considered in terms of their syntax semantics and inference mechanisms as simulations of human recognition interpretation and reasoning with natural language expressions. Thus the aims of the course are to (i) establish competence with the core concepts and analytical tools (ii) develop awareness of the range of applicability of the tools and concepts within linguistic theory and cognitive science (iii) foster confident and fluent use of formal methods in analysing human language and reasoning.
Working methods:
The course relies on lectures and hands-on practice with the formal tools. Self-access practice with the tools is essential. An automated theorem prover is introduced to facilitate specification of formal theories of natural language syntax and semantics within one of the logical languages addressed in the lectures in order to use the theorem prover to test the consequences of theories of language on natural language inputs. Thought- problems designed to test understanding of key concepts will be offered at the end of each session.

Module Learning Aims:
The aim of this module is to introduce students to how speech and language technology as well as computational models of speech and language can be used in the teaching/learning of language. There will be a specific focus throughout on the Irish language and its particular context but an indepth knowledge of the Irish language is unnecessary for participation. The focus is both theoretical and practical and the course emphasizes the multidisciplinary perspectives that are required for effective deployment of technology in education. Students are introduced to a range of speech and language technologies some of which are currently in use for language instruction and some of which though ripe for educational deployment are not yet in use. Learning theories and pedagogical methods are explored in terms of their implications for the development of technological applications in language teaching. The sociolinguistic context is a further major factor which is considered. The broader question of differences in the deployment of the technology in minority and major world languages are discussed.

 
The module will be innovative in encouraging students from technical pedagogic and linguistic backgrounds to explore the interdependence of these areas for the production of materials which are interdisciplinary by nature. Upon completion of the module it is expected that students will have acquired specialised knowledge skills and a theoretical framework for developing educational technology for language instruction.
Module Content:
The module will equip students with a multidisciplinary theoretical framework as a background for the research and development of educational applications of technology. Speech and language technology is explored in detail and its potential for transforming the educational process is discussed. The need for a firm theoretical foundation in language acquisition and pedagogical theory as a precursor to educational content development is a major theme. Furthermore attention is given the linguistic structure of the target language the specific linguistic goals for particular learner cohorts are central considerations. Students also consider the sociocultural context in which the educational technology is being deployed. In this module there is ongoing reference to Irish speech and language technology and the implications of technology for minority and endangered languages in comparison to major world languages are considered. While the module does not require students to have knowledge of the Irish language illustrations with a specific reference to Irish will be used throughout.

Module Content:
This module approaches China as a civilisation in comparison with the ways of life cultivated in the West over the last 3000 years or so. This depth in time helps to keep present-day developments in perspective. Tracking a whole way of life requires taking into account diverse concerns that are commonly treated as the preserves of distinct academic disciplines. Here the focus brings together specific comparative perspectives on education on families on governance systems on economic and ecological attitudes on human nature and psychology and finally on values and world views. Students will be expected to apply the approaches they have already learned and to draw on their Study Abroad experiences in making connections between these various domains in both China and the West. The goal is a richer and possibly a more complicated perspective on ways of life that have endured and grown for millennia
