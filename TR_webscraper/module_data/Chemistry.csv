Introduction – why a good in vitro profile is no indication of in vivo activity
Description and appreciation of Ehrlich’s “magic bullet” insight
The general methods of delivery are described (oral implant topical i.v. etc) and the merits of each approach considered. After illustrating that oral delivery is the preferred method of delivery a drug’s journey is then considered in more detail.
The numerous issues effecting a drug or other chemical’s journey from bottle to site of action are discussed including the acidity of the stomach the phsysiochemical properties required for example sufficient solubility in both aqueous and lipid (cell membrane) based media (log P and log D). The drug must be water soluble enough for transport via the bloodstream but lipophilic enough to diffuse through the cell wall lipid bilayer.
Other issues such as pKa dissolution rate and site of absorption are discussed culminating in Lipinski’s rule of 5.

Alternative methods of cell entry (aqueous pore active transports endocytosis)
Brief discussion of P450 system in terms of metabolism and the effects of other agents in combination (ADME(T)/DMPK)

Overcoming problems using prodrugs

More specific look at options if a poor in vivo profile is observed and how to overcome the variety of problems e.g. low lipophilicity – prodrugs (defined) offer the simplest solution. Examination of the pitfalls and the factors that can be influenced (solubility tissue penetration presystemic metabolism site specificity rate of onset/duration of action toxicity (positive and negative) poor patient compliance formulation problems).

Different classes of prodrugs (bi/tripartite and mutual (carrier linked) and bioprecurors.

Carrier linked

Esters of acids or alcohols and associated electronic and steric effects on release in vivo. Sulfonates phosphonates and amides described.

Numerous examples of bi/tripartite and mutual ester and amide prodrugs affecting the various different factors of influence are provided. Examples applicable to topical absorption are also included

Methenamine described.

Bioprecursors

The story of the development of the discovery of prontisil and bioprecursor prodrugs by Domagk. Definition and numerous examples of oxidative and reductive activation including mechanisms of activation.

In depth analysis of the mode of action of acyclovir and how it exploits virus encoded kinases to ensure selective activation solely in infected cells. 

Macromolecular prodrugs

In which the drug is attached to a polymer. Physiochemical properties dominated by that of the polymer. Uptake in the GI tract is poor and intravascular delivery is generally required size issues - capillaries (especially in the lungs) can become clogged). Loading is variable. Diffusion across membranes is poor but endocytosis mechanisms can be effective. Coverage of issues such as biodegradability addition of solubilising side-chains and linkers to aid release. Examples of natural hormones contraceptives methotraxate and doxorubicin (PK1) on polymers.

The blood brain barrier

Examination of the extra issues involved for drugs to cross the blood-brain-barrier and how dihydropyridine prodrugs can achieve this. Description of the mode of action of nerve agents (via deactivation of acetylcholinesterase) and the associated effects. Mode of action of antidotes for the peripheral nevous system and prodrug antidotes for the CNS. A penicillin based prodrug to cross the BBB to treat bacterial meningitis. Discussion of L-Dopa’s ability to cross the BBB mode of activation mode of action and problems with peripheral activation (preventing the active agent dopamine entering the brain). Use of carbidopa and benzerazide (dopa decarboxylase inhibitors that don’t cross the BBB) to allow low dosing and effective use of L-Dopa. Use of a MAOI prodrug activated by dopa decarboxylase (in combination carbidopa to prevent peripheral activation) that is released within the brain preventing the incompatibilities of MAOIs within the periphery.

Liposomes as delivery devices

General theories loading strategies types of vesicles phospholipids used targeting issues (concentration in the liver) transport in macrophages stealth liposomes targeted liposomes.

Definitions and background (including chemical uses as catalysts) of monoclonal antibodies including interaction and the use of HER2 as the antigen. Description of the production and isolation of antibodies and the subsequent humanisation by gene conversion mutagenesis modelling and nucleic acid exchange to humanise the coding for the recognition region.

mAbs alone can induce an immune response block highly expressed and activated receptors for growth factors or inhibit angiogenesis. They can also be used for targeting radionucleides cytotoxic drugs and toxins. Best example of FDA approved treatment is Mylotarg (gemtuzumab) a humanised CD33 mAb linked to calicheamicin.

Organic Spectroscopy: This topic is concerned with the use of spectroscopic techniques to elucidate the structure of organic compounds. The importance of structural determination will be discussed. The course will focus mainly on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) but will also highlight how other techniques such as Infrared spectroscopy (IR) Ultra Violet/Visible spectroscopy (UV/Vis) mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction can be used in conjunction with NMR to confirm the structure of a compound. The background of NMR will also be described in some detail including how the signals arise what determines chemical shift and how coupling develops. A number of worked examples will be employed to further highlight these concepts. The strength of the other techniques described above with respect to organic structural elucidation will be considered.
