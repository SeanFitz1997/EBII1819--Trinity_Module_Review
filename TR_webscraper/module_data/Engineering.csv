Module Learning Aims:
Mode of Delivery

 The teaching strategy is a mixture of lectures, tutorial and laboratory exercises designed to provide the student with a better knowledge of some advanced theories in structural analysis. The students attend formal lectures during which they are given handouts on parts of the course notes with a few gaps that they fill in during the course of the lecture. The basic course material for most parts of the course is uploaded on the web. The emphasis during the lecture is on allowing the student to focus on the concepts discussed in the lecture. The students are encouraged to pose questions on various issues that may arise.

The tutorials are designed with a view to allow the students to develop modelling skills with an aim to problem solving. The solutions are provided after the attempted tutorials are handed back.

The laboratory exercise is designed to blend and combine three approaches to a technical problem. A problem in structural dynamics is given to them which they first solve analytically. This helps in developing the analytical and conceptual skills. Next, an experiment is designed with the same problem data and the students observe and record the experimental results. The data acquisition provides them with a hands on experience while the report which they submit helps to develop the technical reporting and communication skills. Finally, they analyse the problem numerically by finite element analysis using a commercial software ANSYS, which is quite popular for structural analysis in industrial firms. This part of the exercise exposes the students to commercial packages with a view to introduce them to the experience of industrial application and design in real life situation where complex engineering problems are only possible to be solved numerically using finite elements through software packages.

Sketch a block diagram of the circuit along with user interfaces.

Select a definite test strategy to check each stage of the design.

Obtain and describe timing waveforms.

Write a structured comprehensive technical report on the project.

Work as part of a team.


 
Module Learning Aims:
(a) Analogue Project  The main purpose of the analogue design project is to develop the students’ practical knowledge of the design, simulation, implementation, and testing of analogue electronic circuits. Students learn to work in a group of usually three persons, who must manage the project, divide up the workload between them and apply a ‘divide-and-conquer’ approach to tackling a design task in electronic engineering. Thus, the project involves constructing circuits from components in modular form and testing and documenting each section before proceeding further. This simplifies the task of verifying and modifying the design. 


(b) Digital Project  The main purposes of the project are:

To develop the student's practical knowledge of digital logic gates, displays, and the use of microprocessors such as the PIC and Arduino.

To gain further experience in the design, simulation, implementation and testing of digital circuits.

To develop the ability to work on a project as a member of a team.


 
Module Content:
(a) Analogue Project

SYLLABUS

Measurement of the input and output characteristics of an NPN junction transistor.

Use of the transistor as a simple common emitter amplifier and also in a difference amplifier configuration.

Use of the 741 Op-Amp and IC audio amplifiers to amplify the output from a personal stereo or MP3 player.

Investigation of the ECG signal and how to amplify it for the purpose of observing a subject’s heart beat.

Design and construction of an instrumentation amplifier.

Transmission of the audio signal using a simple AM radio kit. 

TEACHING STRATEGIES  Students learn progressively more difficult design methods and tools as the weeks progress. The project is launched from introductory laboratory exercises with transistors and op-amps which include both construction of circuits and MULTISIM simulations. Support is on hand from the demonstrator and technical officers throughout the project.  The essential steps in the design procedure are explained and illustrated. In the first few weeks, the students are heavily assisted to design, simulate, construct, solder together and test a simple introductory audio amplifier. They see the important role of calculations in circuit design and the problems associated with testing the design by making use of MULTISIM. Students are then required to research, and construct a far more complex amplifier capable of amplifying an ECG signal. This will require knowledge of instrumentation amplifiers and how they are configured from three op-amps. The performance of the simpler circuits will show their limitations and reveal the problems that need to be overcome.


(b) Digital Project

SYLLABUS

Fundamental building blocks of digital circuits from gates to system level devices.

Frequently used important blocks like decoders, multiplexors, flip-flops, shift registers, counters and timers.

Use of block diagrams, circuit schematics with MULTISIM, circuit simulation and testing.

Use of programmable logic (PIC) to simplify or modify designs and reduce cost.

Analysis and design of combinational and synchronous digital systems.

Maintaining good engineering documentation. 



TEACHING STRATEGIES  The hardware construction of two real working circuits is required – one introductory project, and one far more challenging circuit. The project is launched from introductory laboratory exercises with CMOS ICs. Support is on hand from the demonstrator and technical officers throughout the project.

ME3BIO3,3Bio3 Probability And Statistics,Anthony Quinn,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module, the student will be able to:

Quantify beliefs in uncertain propositions related to key electrical, computer and bio- engineering contexts, such as noisy communication, bio-imaging, and large assemblies

Distinguish between the vital notions of independence and dependence, and relate the latter to the idea of prediction 

Apply and analyze the key parametric probability models (distributions) governing uncertainty in these contexts

Evaluate measures of location, spread and dependence for these distributions

Convert random experimental data (samples and surveys) into quantified beliefs, summarize these data via sampling statistics, and assess dependence between data
Module Learning Aims:
This module provides a thorough grounding in probability for electrical, computer and bio- engineering students. In particular, it equips the student with methods for dealing with uncertainty in engineering practice, notably in the analysis of experiments, and the interpretation and processing of data. The keystone of the module is a philosophical one. The relationship between uncertainty and information (learning) is explored from the start. A full review of propositional logic is provided, so that the student can be confident in formulating propositions around an uncertain experiment, and in understanding the logical relationships between propositions. The probability calculus is developed as a consistent means of quantifying and manipulating belief in these uncertain propositions (i.e. the Bayesian perspective). In this way, the foundation of the module is a unified one, with uncertainty, logic, information, observation and imprecision (noise) all embraced within a Bayesian notion of probability.

The main aim is to confront engineering contexts that induce the canonical probability models, in both the discrete case (Bernoulli, geometric, binomial, multinomial, Poisson) and the continuous case (rectangular, exponential, m-Erlang, normal). Their mixtures and transformations are developed, as a response to practical modelling needs. There is a special emphasis on the concept of dependence (conditioning), and its relation to the key engineering notions of correlation and prediction. Sequential dependence is handled in the discrete case only, via a full introduction to Markov chains. A main learning outcome for the student is knowledge of which model applies in which context, and the assumptions justifying the deployment of each model.

This theory is not separated from the engineering practice it aims to serve. Rather, the module carries a number of extended case studies throughout, each progressively refined as our new probability tools become available to us. The main case studies are (i) the noisy digital communication system, using discrete models and, later, the additive Gaussian noise model; (ii) Poisson count bio-imaging contexts (FLIM, SPECT, FLIM); and (iii) reliability and traffic modelling in large device assemblies.

A feature of the module is that it develops statistics consistently using the same inductive inference principles. Typically a black-spot in the formation of the engineering student, statistical inference is re-cast as a problem of probability modelling. Only the simple nonparametric case is considered, using the elegant device of the empirical distribution, readily allowing students to derive sampling statistics for their data. Themes of importance to engineers within the data analysis context are emphasized: (a) quantization error, (b) probability estimation from survey data, and (iii) regression between variables.

The module primes the student for later modules on random processes and statistical signal processing. In its own terms, it is an invitation to confront uncertainty as a fundamental phenomenon – and resource – in engineering systems, and to appreciate probability as a consistent framework for the design, analysis and optimization of such systems.
