According to Gauss ''Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics.'' Number theory can be divided very roughly into 3 parts:

This course is concerned basically with elementary number theory although we shall make a foray into the simplest topic in algebraic number theory namely quadratic number fields. We shall also mention without proof the two basic results of analytic number theory namely the Prime Number Theorem and Dirichlet's Theorem on primes in arithmetic sequences. We begin with the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic Euclid's Theorem that every natural number n>0 is uniquely expressible as a product of primes. (This results is so familiar that one can easily overlook the subtlety of the proof and the enormous step taken by Euclid or his school in establishing it.) Elementary number theory is to a large extend the study of prime numbers. As a kind of game to go with the course we shall join the hunt for the next largest prime number.

According to Gauss ''Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics.'' Number theory can be divided very roughly into 3 parts:

This course is concerned basically with elementary number theory although we shall make a foray into the simplest topic in algebraic number theory namely quadratic number fields. We shall also mention without proof the two basic results of analytic number theory namely the Prime Number Theorem and Dirichlet's Theorem on primes in arithmetic sequences. We begin with the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic Euclid's Theorem that every natural number n>0 is uniquely expressible as a product of primes. (This results is so familiar that one can easily overlook the subtlety of the proof and the enormous step taken by Euclid or his school in establishing it.) Elementary number theory is to a large extend the study of prime numbers. As a kind of game to go with the course we shall join the hunt for the next largest prime number. This is certain to be a Mersenne prime due to the Lucas-Lehmer test which can tell us whether enormously large Mersenne numbers 2p ¿1(where p is a prime) are prime or not. We shall be able to establish as an exercise in quadratic number fields the validity of this test.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module is intended as an introduction to an important computational method of algebra Grobner bases (for 'systems of equations' in a reasonably wide sense). This method implicit in works of various mathematicians for a long time (since at least 1900) has only been made into a general theory as recently as in 1965. It can be viewed as a generalisation of both long division and Gaussian elimination (of unknowns) from linear equations leading to efficient methods of solving systems of polynomial equations and hence applicable in a range of subjects across pure mathematics and 'real life' application s like robotics and image processing. The module will set out theoretical foundations for this theory provide the students with examples to explore and outline some applications of Grobnere bases in natural sciences.

Module Content:
An elliptic curve is non-singular cubic curv. A non-singular quadratic curve is a conic so elliptic curves are the next step in algebraic geometry after the conic sections studied by the ancient Greeks.

An elliptic curve can be brought to Weiersrass stadard from y2 = x3 + bx + c at least if the ground field does not have characteristic 2 or 3.

Elliptic curves have a natural abelia group structure; if P Q are two oints on the curve then the line PQ cuts the curve in third point R and P+Q+R=0

This allows elliptic curves to be studied over all fields in particula finite field providing the basis for elliptic curve crytography (ECC) the standard encryption technique today.

Elliptic curves provided the central tool in Wiles 'proof of Fermat's Last Theorem' that the equations xn+yn=zn has no non-trival integer solution if n>2. They are also the idea behind Fermats proof by infinite descent in the case n=4.

There is an entirely different way of approaching elliptic curves through elliptic functions  and the course will follow both approaches. An elliptic function f(=) is a doubly-periodic complex function and can be thought of as the complex analogue of the real trigonometric functions cos x sin x etc.

These functions and the related modular form are one of the most active areas in mathematics today at the intersection of number theory algebraic geometry and complex analysis (Ramanujan's Conjectures on modular forms published 100 years ago remain a lively topic in number theory.)

Rational and Aims - The purpose of module MA3431 is to outline the properties of a classical field theory that relate in particular to scalar and vector fields to point out features of the tensor calculus suitable for the description of relativistic non-quantum field theories and to indicate the importance of symmetry and invariance principles in the development of conservation laws for energy momentum and other conserved quantities. The module is mandatory for third year undergraduate students of theoretical physics but may optionally be taken by third or fourth year undergraduate students of mathematics. Postgraduate students from other institutions have taken the module in the past. The module forms an element of the undergraduate programme in theoretical physics being built upon prerequisite first and second year courses in classical dynamics and mathmatics and leading to courses in the fourth and final year including quantum field theory. From a teaching point of view the intention of the lecturer is to indicate how powerful analytical and formal methods can be invoked to understand and solve many problems in mathematical physics. A further intention is to provide a sense of the important role played by field theories particularly electrodynamics in the development of theoretical physics and its applications.

MA3443,Statistical Physics I,Dmytro Volin,"Learning Outcomes:
 In this course we will study macroscopic systems i.e. systems that consist of very large number of smaller ones. Because of the large number of components they acquire new significant properties which do not exist on the level of single particles. The main such property is existence of the function called entropy and of the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy always increases. Our main goal would be to master these concepts and understand how they emerge from the microscopic description i.e. from classical or quantum mechanics when it is applied to the system with very large number of components. On the way we will learn a lot of interesting math encounter several exciting physical phenomena and do a bit of computer simulations for ideal gas and random processes.

To understand statistical physics we are going to learn a considerable amount of mathematical tools which have applications in diverse areas of science. Hence you may perceive a large part of this course as an advanced calculus and introduction to combinatorics/probability/information theory. There are many computational assignments during the term. One motivation to take MA3443 is to improve your practical skills in the mentioned mathematical topics.

Basic Rules

Senior Sophister students may choose to take a project/thesis module (MA4492) provided that the agreement of the MA4492 module coordinator is explicitly given and that a member of staff is willing to supervise the work.

The basic standard of the work should correspond to a 10 credits of advanced level modules in depth and difficulty. Ideally the topic should touch on something in the recent research literature (paper in a journal or a preprint) or involve a novel implementation or calculation.

A written thesis must be submitted and the students concerned will also be asked to make an oral presentation of their work. Where relevant any computer source code should be submitted. The external examiner will assess the marking of the projects along with examination scripts.

The Head of the School of Mathematics will appoint a module MA4492 coordinator for each academic year.

Students and their project/thesis supervisors should arrange to meet on a regular basis to discuss the progress of the work.


Deadlines

Work on the project must commence before the second week of Michaelmas term in the Senior Sophister year and the agreement of the MA4492 module coordinator should be obtained by this time. Students may opt to discontinue the project before the end of Michaelmas term and change to a regular (advanced) course.

The supervisor of the project/thesis should warn the student during Michaelmas term if the work is not proceeding satisfactorily.

Theses/Projects should be completed and submitted three weeks before the end of Hilary term (which means Friday March 13th in 2015) and will be subject to a subsequent viva voce presentation held before the end of Hilary term.

Theses must be submitted to the module MA4992 coordinator who will give each student a receipt. (It is most helpful if students submit a PDF copy of their thesis via email plus one [spiral] bound hard copy to the coordinator.) The coordinator will acknowldge receipt via email.

Each thesis must include a statement signed by the student that the thesis is their own work except where due citations are given.

Here are some of the considerations that will be used by the examiners in arriving at the marks.

Oral presentation.
Did the student make a comprehensible presentation which summarised adequately their main achievements? Used the time available well? Did answers to any questions show mastery of the material?

Bibliography.
Is it there? Is it formatted in a recognisable style used by journals in the field (with author names source [journal or publisher] date pages)? Is it adequate in coverage?

Clarity of exposition and style of writing
Is there clarity and precision in the explanations given? Is there a clear development of the ideas? Is the terminology clearly laid out?

Understanding of the material | Understanding of the problem and the background
Are the ideas explained and developed in a way that makes it clear that the student has understood them?

Difficulty of the topic | Appropriate research method?
Case (i) Difficulty: is this a challenging topic for the student as compared to the standard of sophister modules? Has the student made contact with recent published literature?
Case (ii) Method: has the student gone about the project in a sensible way? Modified strategy in the light of early results or difficulties encountered?

Originality
In case (i) can you see the students own viewpoint? In case (ii) did the student succeed and was it a substantial accomplishment?

Guidelines for the thesis
Students should bear in mind the following when writing up their work.

The account should be in the style of a scientific thesis (a mathematical one perhaps an expository one); understandable by a mathematician or theoretical physicist (or statistician or computer scientist) who may not be in the same field;

So should have title your name as the author chapters or sections of content and a bibliography.

Should convey what you have done as well as you can in a pedagogical style and should include discussion of background material you had to master and any difficulties encountered.

Start with an abstract then an overall summary and then some background.

We expect an amount of effort and sophistication equivalent to a full year 5+5 = 10 credit course. Does your write-up show that? It should also have enough content to show that (and 40 pages is suggested as a minimum length).

Don't transcribe stuff. If you find a perfect explanation of something it is probably best to refer to it (if it is long anyway). If you reproduce an explanation in the literature with your own slant or more explanations of the steps this is not a problem. You should cite the sources of things you use.
