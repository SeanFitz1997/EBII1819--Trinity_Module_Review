Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The term Digital Humanities seems an oxymoron. What you might ask has computation to do with centuries old arts and humanities disciplines. Hasn’t tried and true methods of creating arguments with pen and paper (or now word processors and printouts) served the field admirably? What do the concerns of other disciplines such as information science (standards metadata ontologies controlled vocabularies) and computer science (database modelling semantic web human-computer interaction scripting) have to do with a discipline like literary studies? The answer is everything.

 
This course will explore the burgeoning field of digital humanities – how computational methods are being used to further research and teaching in literary studies. This course will explore how advanced and experimental techniques are being used to challenge and change the very nature of what it means to do research in the field of literature.

 
We will explore areas such as thematic research collections a new genre akin that melds features of scholarly articles and monographs with traditional archival practice; 3D virtual recreations of ancient cities or monastic ruins; born digital literature that embraces sound images and video as easily as text and poses new and substantial challenges in the area of preservation; and the experimental field of datamining and visualization which may provide us with more effective ways of ‘reading’ hundreds even thousands of texts.

EN4366,The Gawain-Poet,Brendan O'Connell,"Learning Outcomes:
This one-semester course focuses on the works of a remarkable medieval poet the author of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. In addition to his most celebrated work he is believed to be the author of three other exceptional Middle English poems: Pearl Cleanness and Patience. All four works survive in a unique copy and we will consider each poem in the order preserved in this manuscript. Pearl a poetic masterpiece is a father’s moving lament for his lost daughter and a profound statement of the gulf between the physical and spiritual the human and the divine. In sharp contrast Cleanness offers a startling apocalyptic vision of mass death and destruction portraying human depravity and divine retribution in unforgettable depictions of the biblical Flood and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Altogether more witty and playful Patience tells another biblical narrative: the story of Jonah and the Whale. This miniature masterpiece describes one man’s hopeless and comic struggle with his destiny and in many ways anticipates the final poem in the manuscript the splendid Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Beginning with a Christmas game in which the uncanny Green Knight presents Arthur’s court with a lethal challenge this wonderful narrative charts the fortunes of its hero Sir Gawain as he navigates a world full of danger temptation and unwelcome revelations. While each poem will be considered in its own right we will also highlight ways in which each text illuminates its neighbours and ask what features unify the output of this brilliant but elusive master of medieval literature.

Module Content:
“If we had less imagination we would feel more secure.” (Yi-Fu Tuan Landscapes of Fear)

 
This one-term course will explore the relationship between the individual and their physical environment in American horror and gothic texts from the beginnings of an independent American literary culture to the present day. From the seemingly savage wilderness that confronted the first European settlers to the brutal realities of frontier life and latterly the rather different varieties of terror found in the rural urban (and then suburban) environments American authors and filmmakers have displayed a notable fascination with the impact that the landscape has upon those who reside there. This course will explore the many reasons why this is the case and also consider the differing ways in which horror and gothic depictions of specific geographical and architectural settings serve to dramatise some of the most profound anxieties and preoccupations associated with the American way of life and American history.

 
Critical reading and short stories to be discussed in class will be made available on Blackboard at the beginning of term. F = Film.

      some of their writings in detail

2. Justify the usefulness of including early modern women writers in the study of English

      literature

3. Recognize the major themes and issues in the assigned texts which set them apart from

      early modern texts authored by men

9. Know how to identify and access the most essential sources of information (reference       books databases) about early modern women writers 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This course brings together the most prominent women writers of the 16th and 17th centuries. The authors come from a fascinating variety of backgrounds: Mary Sidney and Mary Wroth belonged to one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Elizabethan England; Elizabeth Cary was reduced to poverty following her conversion to Catholicism; Katherine Phillips sided with the Royalists during the Civil War while her husband was a Parliamentarian; Hannah Woolley ran a free grammar school and earned money from her manuals on household management. At the same time each of the writers we will be reading in some form had to deal with prejudice against female authorship and socio-economic conditions which were generally adverse to women composing and publishing their works. We will discuss how the texts document these challenges and how their authors managed to participate in the country’s male-dominated literary culture while at the same time imagining and even creating alternative female-centered communities.

Develop an ability to distinguish genre-specific modes of spatial production in literature as part of a critical strategy of reading spatially.


Enhance the capacity to understand narratives of Irish culture in oppositional terms; the module is intended to interact with existing sophister options in Irish studies.

Acquire a familiarity with a range of recent Irish literature of the city and its contexts and develop the ability to think critically about it.
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
What has become known as the ‘spatial turn’ in the humanities has alerted us to the ways in which the spaces we inhabit are produced by culture. These seminars take as their starting point the premise that Irish writing since the end of the nineteenth century (the massive exception of Joyce notwithstanding) has defined itself predominantly in terms of versions of the pastoral and this in turn has had implications for the ways in which it has been possible to write the city as an Irish space. The central avenue in this module runs through the question of how literature produces space and how this occurs differently across literary forms (fiction poetry drama). However there will be diversions down sidestreets to encounter crime fiction writing and memory the flaneur psychogeography modernity and the mediations of culture. There will be glances at visual culture as well as excursions into history and architecture all with a view to sketching an outline map of the Irish city in literature.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The establishment and early years of the Abbey Theatre are well documented; less is known about the overall theatrical scene in Dublin at that time and in succeeding decades. The object of this one-semester course is to explore the Dublin stage from the closing years of the nineteenth century when melodrama was the dominant form of popular culture through to the 1950s and 60s a period that saw the opening of the Gate and Pike Theatres the first Dublin Theatre Festival and the emergence of new playwrights such as Tom Murphy. Each class will focus closely on a significant play of the period but the text will be considered in its overall cultural theatrical and political contexts. A range of theatrical elements from staging to reviews will be examined in an attempt to capture the essence of each production in its own time. Sessions will consist of an introductory lecture followed by a seminar. Assessment will be in two parts: one research exercise and one essay.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
W.B. Yeats is both one of the most important European writers of the twentieth century and an eccentric figure characterised by W.H. Auden as ‘silly like us.’ This course will trace how Yeats drew inspiration from a diverse range of cultural aesthetic and political phenomena to create works in a range of genres that made him a lightning rod for his period and a remarkable literary figure of enduring fascination. Although Yeats’s reputation rests primarily on his poetry his sustained influence on Irish cultural debate through his critical writing continues to be immense; and while his theatre is more often acknowledged than staged it is often radical in its understanding of the nature of performance. This seminar will consider the international as well as Irish context of Yeats’s creative imagination. It will explore works from across the range of Yeats’s work beginning with his poetry but will also give full consideration to his prose and his work for the theatre. We will examine Yeats’s work through close reading work with manuscripts in the National Library analysis of productions and adaptations of his work and engagement with his critical legacy.

EN7027,The Victorian Child,Coordinator Jarlath,"Learning Outcomes:
When they have completed this module students will have a clear sense of the development of the fields of both children's literature and the child in Victorian society over recent decades. They will also have a sound grasp of the connections that exist between these fields especially in terms of theoretical understandings of the literature of childhood.
Module Learning Aims:
The course's main aims are (i) to introduce students to issues and debates concerning the role of children in Victorian society (ii) to introduce students to issues and debates in the academic study of children's literature (iii) to encourage students to recognise the relationships between the texts on the course and material from the wider Victorian world (advertisements art history political debates sociological tracts) (iv) to examine the theoretical interventions concerning both Victorian children and children's literature in general and the critical debates concerning childhood agency and sexuality made in sociological psychological and historical study by a wide range of theorists (v) to question the value and appropriateness of the concept of the `child' (vi) to question the value and appropriateness of the concept of `children's literature'.
Module Content:
This course studies in detail the idea of the child in Victorian culture both through texts about children and texts for children. We ask why the child became a figure of such importance for the Victorians what particular attributes they assigned to her what function she served in society. The course also facilitates an examination of the issues surrounding the academic study of children's literature and its relation to the `adult' canon. We consider the various novels as individual texts but also as comprising a recommended reading list for children. Other problems considered include the problem of allegory the issue of didacticism and the relation between ethics and literature.

Michaelmas Term: Weeks 1-6

 
Jonathan Swift (1667-1745): Prof. Aileen Douglas

 
This section of the course will consider a range of Swift’s writings in poetry and prose. Seminars will explore Swift’s works in relation to a number of opposed terms: Ireland/England; print/manuscript; private/public. Issues of gender and questions of literary form will also be foregrounded.
 
Week 1-6: Set reading will be distributed at the first seminar. 

 
Primary Texts

Jonathan Swift Swift: Major Works ed. Angus Ross & David Woolley (rev. ed. 2008)

Jonathan Swift Gulliver's Travels ed. Claude Rawson & Ian Higgins (2005)

 
Suggested Preliminary Reading

On Swift and Ireland O. W Ferguson’s Jonathan Swift and Ireland (1962) is still a valuable study. Carole Fabricant’s Swift's Landscape (1982; repr. 1995) and Robert

Mahony’s Jonathan Swift:The Irish Identity (1995) are also significant works.

The Cambridge Companion to Jonathan Swift (2003) edited by Christopher Fox is a good place to orient oneself in relation to Swift criticism as are the essays in Locating Swift ed. Aileen Douglas Patrick Kelly and Ian Campbell Ross (1998).

 
The standard biography of Swift is Irvin Ehrenpreis Swift: The Man His Works and the Age 3 vols. (1962-83). David Nokes David Jonathan Swift: A Hypocrite Reversed (1985) is a very readable single-volume biography as is Leo Damrosch Jonathan Swift: His Life and his World (2013). For those unfamiliar with Swift and eighteenth-century Ireland Joseph McMinn’s Jonathan Swift: A Literary Life (1991) is a lively and accessible introduction.

 
 
Michaelmas Term: Weeks 8-12

 
 
W.B. Yeats (1865-1939): Prof. Tom Walker

 
The course will examine a range of Yeats’s poetry drama and prose. Structured loosely around different phases of his career seminars will emphasise key historical and cultural contexts as well as attending to questions of poetics and ideology.

 
Week 8:Folklore and Symbolism

Poems: ‘The Stolen Child’ ‘The Man who Dreamed of Faeryland’ ‘To Ireland in the Coming Times’ ‘The Song of Wandering Aengus’ ‘The Valley of the Black Pig’ ‘The Secret Rose’

       Prose: sections from On the Boiler

 
Primary Texts

W.B. Yeats The Major Works ed. Edward Larrissy (Oxford World’s Classics)

 
The texts marked with an asterisk above are not in this edition; copies of them will be provided in advance of each relevant session. Members of the seminar are strongly encouraged to begin their reading of primary texts in advance of the first class meeting.

 
Selected Criticism

Getting some biographical hold on Yeats is important. His life is consciously integrated into his work and he was a publically prominent writer through most of his career. The best two accounts are: R. F. Foster W. B. Yeats: A Life 2 vols (1997 and 2002); and Terence Brown’s more critically inclined (and somewhat shorter) The Life of W.B. Yeats (2001). Also still very illuminating and entertaining is Richard Ellmann’s classic Yeats: the Man and the Masks (2nd ed. 1973). David Pierce Yeats’s Worlds: Ireland England and the Poetic Imagination (1995) is also informative and well illustrated. Good places to start to orientate oneself in relation to Yeats criticism are: John Kelly and Marjorie Howes eds The Cambridge Companion to W.B. Yeats (2006); and David Holdeman and Ben Levitas eds Yeats in Context (2010). A more detailed bibliography will be distributed at the beginning of the course.

 
 
Hilary Term: Weeks 1-6

 
 
James Joyce (1882-1941): Prof Sam Slote

 
This course will examine Ulysses from a variety of perspectives: Joyce as an ‘Irish writer’; Joyce as an ‘English writer’; Joyce as a ‘European writer’; the poetics of style and form; the politics of style and form; modes of ideology (race religion gender and nation); framing a literary tradition; the production and reception of Modernism; etc. We will begin with A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and discuss that novel insofar as it leads towards Ulysses thematically and stylistically. We will also discuss the composition of Ulysses as is indicated on the NLI Ulysses drafts.

 
Week 1:A Portrait and Ulysses: ‘Telemachus’ – ‘Nestor’

Week 2:Ulysses: ‘Proteus’ – ‘Hades’

Week 3:Ulysses: ‘Æolus’ – ‘Wandering Rocks’

Week 4:Ulysses: ‘Sirens’ – ‘Oxen of the Sun’

Week 5:Ulysses: ‘Circe’ – ‘Eumæus’

Week 6:Ulysses: ‘Ithaca’ – ‘Penelope’

 
Please read A Portrait and the first two episodes of Ulysses (‘Telemachus’ and ‘Nestor’) for the first class.

 
Primary Texts

James Joyce Ulysses ed. Hans Walter Gabler (London: the Bodley Head 1993). I strongly recommend the Gabler edition.

James Joyce A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Any edition will suffice.

 
Preliminary Reading

Among the books you might want to read in advance for this course are the following:

 

Derek Attridge How to Read Joyce (London: Granta 2007).

Derek Attridge ed. The Cambridge Companion to James Joyce (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2004 2nd ed.).

Richard Ellmann James Joyce (Oxford: Oxford University Press 1982 rev. ed.).

Terence Killeen ‘Ulysses’ Unbound (Wicklow: Wordwell 2004).

John McCourt ed. James Joyce in Context (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2009).

 
The Killeen book is especially recommended as a guidebook for first-time readers.

 
Hilary Term: Weeks 8-12

 
 
Samuel Beckett (1906-1989): Prof Julie Bates

 
Beckett’s legacy is formidable in both fiction and drama having left both literary forms profoundly altered and his creative praxis was evidently enriched by moving from one form to another. This series of lectures and seminars will map Beckett’s distinct authorial procedure by exploring five formal and thematic features of his writing in both fiction and drama tracing the ways in which Beckett was engaged in an ongoing attempt to give shape to certain recurring themes – a creative project that lasted more than half a century and found expression in ceaseless formal experimentation. We will also visit Trinity’s Manuscripts and Archives Research Library to view some of Beckett’s manuscripts and letters in person. Students are encouraged to consider drawing on these materials in their essays. In order to do justice to Beckett’s prolific creativity the course will examine a wide range of his works. Those works in bold will be central to the lecture and subsequent discussion each week:

Note on dates:

I’ve noted the dates of publication of each work to give a sense of how each week’s lecture and discussion will span several decades of Beckett’s work. Where two dates are given the first indicates the work’s initial publication in French and the second its subsequent publication in English because we need to be attentive to the role and impact of self-translation in Beckett’s evolving creative practice.

EN7089,Writing The Troubles,CoordinatorTerence Brown,"Learning Outcomes:
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The outbreak of the Troubles in Northern Ireland in 1968 took place at the same time as the emergence of a group of poets who would go on to achieve international reputations. For these poets a response to the crisis in Northern Ireland and especially to the violence there presented a moral and aesthetic challenge. The first part of this course therefore will allow students to study some of their key poems in the context of the conflict.

Dramatists and novelists also took up the tasks of representing the Troubles and of seeking to understand their psychological cultural and social causes. A second part of the course will allow study of selected plays and works of fiction that appeared during the Troubles which dealt directly with the Troubles themselves or sought to comprehend them in broader contexts. Issues of family gender and sexuality as well as politics and confessional identity will be seen as salient to such projects. A final class will consider how one journalist dealt directly with the reportage of violence.

The course will comprise a series of seminars on the following topics:

Week 1:Seamus Heaney ‘The Tollund Man' ‘Punishment'*

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This course traces the continuation and development of ‘Big House literature’ in post-independence Irish writing. The course begins with an introductory class which outlines theories of the genre and contextualises some of the readings for the course. A central question of the course is whether the survival of Big House literature in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries is illustrative of the ‘generative power’ of the genre as Vera Kreilkamp has suggested or whether it demonstrates the ‘comparative poverty’ of the Irish literary tradition in the words of Seamus Deane.

EN7116,Writing For A Living,Carlo Gébler,"Learning Outcomes:
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
In order to make a living creative writers (poets novelists playwrights) usually have to do all sorts of other kinds of writing in parallel with their preferred one. These other kinds of writing include (and the list is far from exhaustive) literary reviews reports (for publishers or cultural institutions) treatments (usually for film or television or radio) features (for print media) catalogue copy (usually though not necessarily for fine artists) introductions references manifestos invectives polemics and travelogues.

 
Those currently studying for the M.Phil. in Creative Writing at the Oscar Wilde Centre for Irish Writing will very likely on gradation when they enter the field find themselves being required to produce some of the kinds of text described above and this module Writing for a Living will prepare them it is hoped for this eventuality and it will do that in the following ways. One it will immerse the student in these various forms and genres and two it will oblige the student to try his or her hand at writing some of them.

 
Structure

The module will be delivered through a series of two hour workshops that will run for eleven weeks in Michaelmas term. Assessment will be on the basis of a 5000 word essay or project the form of which will be decided in discussion with Professor Gébler.
