CP7000,Mphil Cc Theory And Methodology 1,coordinator Peter,"Learning Outcomes:
The course will enable students to:

•   understand and contextualize a host of relevant material relating to comparative literature and translation studies,

•   apply theory to literature,

•   constantly think about how to apply their reading of theory to a selection of literature that they want to compare,

•   sharpen their critical and analytical skills,

•   learn about the various debates that surround the field of comparative literature and translation studies,

•   research and write an essay (form a hypothesis, structure an argument and build an essay, reference outside sources);

•   and present a paper (form a hypothesis, structure an oral presentation; maintain and sustain relations with the listeners, give an overview of sources)

 
 

 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Alain Badiou once said that he does not really believe in comparative literature but that it has to be done all the same. Similar theories surround the field of translation, for example, that nothing can be translated or that everything is translatable. Comparison and translation share the fact that something is brought to another side, that boundaries are being crossed in the process of these activities. What is the object of study in comparative literature? How do we or ought we to compare? What are the limits of this field? And how should a text best be translated? Are translated texts like les belles infidèles, beautiful if unfaithful to the original and ugly if not? These are among the questions we will discuss in this seminar. This course is a seminar, not a lecture course, which means that it will live largely from student input and discussion

CP7001,Moving Between Cultures,coordinator Peter,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students will be able to:

•   Demonstrate knowledge of a variety of ways in which travel is used thematically, metaphorically and structurally in literature

•   Contextualise chosen primary texts within an appropriate theoretical framework

•   Analyse texts comparatively

•   Research and present a paper (identify a research question, structure an oral presentation, use visual aids as appropriate, maintain and sustain relations with the listeners, provide an overview of sources)

 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The course aims to explore fundamental issues relating to moving between cultures across a representative range of primarily European perspectives, tackling some of the theoretical and methodological issues raised by travel writing and other related forms of cultural expression. ""Moving Between Cutures"" lasts for two 9-week terms (Michaelmas and Hilary), with a couple of extra meetings in the final (Trinity) term. It will follow, in roughly chronological order, at the rate of two hours per week, a series of linguistically and culturally homogeneous mini-corpuses, each of which will raise an important issue relating to travel writing. In this way some of the multiple levels of conception and expression of intercultural movement will be identified and investigated. Two strands in particular will be explored: the theme of the imaginary trip as it moves from legendary travel, through fictional voyage to time travel (with focus on Irish, English, Russian and Slavonic texts); and the theme of travel in the real world as it involves arrivals and departures, homecoming and adventure, cultural and spatial movement (involving Italian, Germanic and Hispanic corpuses). In addition, some of the more specifically theoretical and semiotic issues raised by travel will be confronted in the sessions devoted to the travel writings of recent or contemporary French theorists.
Elements of overlap between these categories and the ultimately problematic nature of any kind of classification of cultural movement and exchange will be explored in a couple of sessions at the end of the year which a number of the class teachers will be present.

CP7003,Mphil Cc Theory And Methodology: Literature And.........,coordinator Peter,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this model students will be able to:

• analyse literary texts through the lens of another discipline, i.e., think critically in interdisciplinary ways

• understand the importance of crossing boundaries of discourses and ways of thinking

• apply specific theories generated by other disciplines to literary studies.

• research and write an essay (form a hypothesis, structure the essay, think critically about primary and secondary sources and refer to them in footnotes)

• draw on a range of disciplines from cultural studies that broaden the way we interpret literature

• understand comparative literature as more than just comparing literature and present their ideas for the essay in a coherent way by the end of the semester

 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
For obvious intents and purposes the concept of intertextuality is of heightened interest to comparatists and translators, as we are dealing with dialogues between texts. Intertextual studies, however, threaten to collapse into mere random mushroom hunts for parallels between texts, unless such studies contain another element that gives them glue. This third element in a comparison of texts is the tertium comparationis without which comparative literature cannot exist, and from which literary translations will likewise profit. If we compare Joyce's Ulysses with Homer's Odyssey we can do so via mythological patterns or focus on certain motifs or themes that both texts contain. If we compare Richardson's Clarissa with Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther we may choose to look at the genre of the epistolary novel or other features of the age of sensibility. These examples, however, are still limiting us, since the tertium comparationis stems from literary theory or literature itself. Once we leave literary theory for cultural theory and beyond this for other disciplines, we gain a wider spectrum of possibilities for comparative literature and a deeper understanding of literature for the literary translator. It can therefore be safely ascertained that if they want to be fruitful comparative literature and the art of literary translation have to develop awareness beyond the notion of intertextuality: as part of their hermeneutic motion these two inter-related fields have to interpret literature through the prism of other disciplines. This course will look at literature through various extra-disciplinary lenses and thus try to hone comparatists' skills in moving between various discourses and their practices.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module explores the way in which literature, in thematising travel / movement / border-crossing, also foregrounds the question of how cultures define themselves in comparison to one another. Sometimes the interaction of cultures is brought about by migration, tourism or war; sometimes it is an imaginative act in which unreal otherworlds or afterlives are explored. What is common to both types of movement, however, is that they show us how individual, collective, national identities are negotiated and constructed in moving between self and other, between the native and the foreign. Travelling through time and space, the history and geography of our comings and goings are recast as a paradigm for reading all culture as the product of a comparison.

Module Learning Aims:
The main objective of this course is to give a deeper understanding of the French language as it exists today. The purpose of this course is to show that French is a many-faceted social instrument which may be delicately modified to suit the multitude of situations in which it is used on a daily basis. The French language, like any other language in current use, is not a petrified object, but a malleable organism which responds to the needs and demands of its users.
Module Content:
In addition to looking at the factors which have produced the mainstream variety of French, official standard French, the module looks at and evaluates attempts to control the language and also provides a technique for describing types of French which may be encountered but which differ in some way from Standard French. The concept of variation in language is considered and the various factors which determine the way a speaker speaks or a writer writes in a particular set of circumstances are identified. The influence of geographical origin (with particular reference to the languages of France and regional and dialectal French), age, sex, socioeconomic status and register will be examined in detail.

• Organise and present ideas in English and French, in writing and orally, within the framework of a structured and reasoned critical argument.
• Use the appropriate methodologies and relevant resources for the presentation of coursework.
Module Learning Aims:
The learning aims of this module are to:
• Provide students with an insight into the literary and theoretical works of two major French authors of the twentieth century.
• Offer students the opportunity to familiarise themselves with theoretical approaches to literature that were decisive in shaping twentieth-century French thought.
• Provide students with a close-reading experience of literary texts as they engage with theoretical issues arising from that experience.
• Offer students the necessary skills to approach and interpret notoriously difficult literary and theoretical texts.
Module Content:
What is literature? The question has fascinated writers and philosophers alike for centuries, and it is the purpose of this module to look at some of the most engaging and powerful responses the twentieth century has to offer. The module is designed to provide undergraduate students with conceptual tools to think about literature by examining writers and thinkers whose works – literary and theoretical – have laid some of the foundations of modern literary thought. What does it mean to theorise literature? Does a theory of literature adequately address the experience of literature? And can literature actually convey experience in the first place? What happens when literature produces its own experience and its own theory? What if literature was the experience of its theory or the theory of its experience? This module will explore these and other related questions by introducing students to two key French figures of the twentieth century: Maurice Blanchot (1907-2003) and Georges Bataille (1897-1962). The focus of this module will be twofold: first, we shall concentrate on works of fiction by the two authors under discussion (Thomas l’Obscur and Madame Edwarda) and see how a close-reading of these works raises theoretical questions about literary experience; second, we shall look at the ways in which these thinkers have sought to account for the experience of literature in their theoretical writings. The module will offer students an opportunity to address the issues at stake from a variety of perspectives (philosophical, affective, anthropological, mystical, aesthetic) and is designed to assist them in developing and enhancing both their analytical skills and their conceptual language. As such, this module will be especially useful as a preparation for those wishing to explore critical thought and literary theory in the post-war and post-1968 periods in more advanced classes. Whilst prior knowledge of literary theory is not a requirement, students should be prepared to engage with theoretical questions. Taught in French, the module is assessed by an essay (2,500-3000 words).

A personal identity perspective: the ways in which Erik Erikson’s psychosocial approach to identity integrates historical, biological, psychological and sociocultural forces.
Social identity theory: Social identity is a person’s sense of who they are, based on their group membership(s). Tajfel (1979) proposed that the groups (e.g. social class, family, football team etc.) to which people belonged were an important source of pride and self-esteem. Groups provide a sense of social identity: a sense of belonging to the social world.

• To allow students to evaluate current research in travel literature
• To allowing students to critically assess different ways of capturing concepts of mobility in research
Module Content:
The desire to move is one of the most fundamental aspects of the human condition. Mythologies, world religions, literatures all contain accounts of people who set out on journeys of exploration to discover new worlds, new forms of behaviour, new ways of understanding the self and other. Accounts of travels have existed for centuries in the French language and this course will focus in particular on the late modern period. In addition to considering the basic impulses behind the desire to travel and give an account of these travels, the course will examine how travel has been used to explore questions around identity, politics, aesthetics, gender and language. The uniquely hybrid genre of travel writing has meant that writers have been free to explore a wide variety of issues while bringing their readers to places and cultures that are often little understood or analysed. In addition, attention will be paid to the effects of movement, travel and exploration on the development of a variety of practices from photography to airport culture which have deeply influenced the experience of late modernity. Following in the footsteps of French-language travellers from the late 1930s to very recent times, the aim will be to show how travel writing offers us a unique way of engaging with writing and the world.

• Develop academic written and oral skills in English and in French through essay-writing and in-class presentations.
Module Learning Aims:
The beginning of the twentieth century witnessed an explosion of artistic creativity in France and across Europe. Artists, writers, and poets began questioning the conditions that had led to the First World War and expressed doubts about whether art was capable of representing the chaos of the times. Literature and the arts became the testing ground for critiquing man’s claim to rationality: by revealing the limits of our mastery over language and the insufficiency of our linguistic tools, writers, poets, and artists explored the boundaries between artistic forms, in order to destabilize our conventional processes of sense-making. We will explore these fertile years according to a two-fold approach: on the one hand, by focusing on the different literary practices developed by poets and writers to respond to the madness of the times (explorations of the fine line between dream and reality, sense and nonsense, reason and unreason in the works of Apollinaire and Breton); on the other hand, by analysing the significance of these practices in opening up a dialogue between artistic forms (in the painting, film, and photography of Magritte, Dalí, Buñuel, and Man Ray).

Module Content:
Beginning in the early modern period, the French language has spread to many parts of the world. As the language became rooted in different locations from Canada to Indochina, literatures in French began to emerge which gave expression to the very different experiences of writers living outside of France. These writings gave us a fascinating insight into a host of cultures across the planet and demonstrate how French can open up the reader to a variety of experiences, myths, worldviews that challenge conventional or overly narrow views of French-speaking culture. The course will trace the birth of new literatures in French in the Americas before examining the emergence of vibrant literary cultures in North and sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia. The themes of colonisation, decolonisation, hybridity, négritude, créolité, globalisation will be explored alongside debates around littérature-monde and world literature in French. The texts will provide a gateway into a range of French-language writing that demonstrates the variety and richness of French-language engagement with world cultures.

Module Content:
Wir leben wieder einmal in einem ""untoten"" Zeitalter: Bram Stokers Dracula wurde 2009 zum ""Stadtbuch"" von Dublin gewählt und Stephenie Meyers Romane füllten immer wieder die Schaufenster der Buchhandlungen – und Kinos - weltweit. Weniger bekannt dürfte sein, dass Texte in deutscher Sprache – und habsburgische Geopolitik - eine wichtige Rolle spielten, als nach 1732 der Vampirismus in Europa bekannt und zum Thema kultureller Debatten wurde. 1748 erscheint das erste Vampirgedicht der westlichen Literaturen – in deutscher Sprache. Aber auch spätere Texte (darunter einige österreichischer AutorInnen) haben dem Thema wichtige oder zumindest interessante Aspekte hinzugefügt.
Mein Seminar wird sich der Frage annehmen, was der Vampir als kulturelles Phantasma im sakulären Zeitalter nach der Aufklärung ""bedeutet"": Für welche ""unsichtbaren"" Themen wird er, der kein Spiegelbild hat, als literarischer ""Container"" verwendet? Welche Diskurse verbergen sich hinter seiner Gestalt, die sich stets verwandelt? Was ist seine ""Ästhetik"" und ""Politik""? Häufig verkörpert der Vampir das ethnisch Fremde, so z.B. Phantasien über den ""Balkan""...
Dahinter steht die Frage, wie eine ""westliche"" Kultur überhaupt mit dem ""Anderen"", d.h. mit Alterität (otherness) und Alienität (z.B. Monstren) umgeht – und dabei zeigt sich, dass der Vampir als Figur des Imaginären durchaus ""reale"" Spiegelbilder hat: Gender und Sexualität, Macht und Herrschaft, Rassismus, Immigration etc. Dies soll anhand einer Textauswahl mit Schwerpunkt auf dem 20. Jh. gezeigt und diskutiert werden.

Module Content:
The nineteenth century notoriously re-thought the human subject in biological and psychological terms, moving away from Christian understandings of humankind to an increasingly secular view. This major paradigm shift of modernity was fraught with conflicts: while the turn to science emerged in part from Enlightenment optimism in human rationality, reason, and progress, from the mid-nineteenth century on this optimism increasingly gave way to pessimism, as writers, thinkers, and critics observed the effects of rapid modernization on different social groups. Against the ideal of modernity as persistent progress and continuing social improvement appeared the darker view of modernity as pathological, decadent, and sick. This went hand in hand with the historical decline of empire, the rise of bourgeois capitalism, and the crisis of masculinity. In this context, the new sciences of psychiatry and psychoanalysis explored – and thereby partly constructed – pathologies of the modern self with an emphasis on physical, sexual, and psychological deviance. This module frames the discussion of modern pathologies of the self against the backdrop of the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and with reference to the influential scientific outlooks of Austro-German psychiatrist, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, and the Viennese founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. It examines three texts from the period in question: Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s Venus im Pelz (1870), Franz Kafka’s short story Ein Landarzt (1917), and Arthur Schnitzler’s novella, Fräulein Else (1924). We will explore how these literary works expressed, often satirically, the major themes of pessimistic modernity through extreme images of the body, and also how they engaged with new ideas concerning sexual and psychological pathologies.

Module Content:
This course introduces students to German-Jewish literature of the 20th century. It offers a broad historical perspective on the socio-cultural positioning of the German-Jewish subject, focusing on the experiences of exclusion and marginality that characterise the ‘conditio judaica’ (the Jewish condition). Utilising a group of texts that articulate pivotal moments of upheaval, change or crisis in German-Jewish experience of the 20th century, the course provides students with a focused overview of this period up to the contemporary. Franz Kafka’s letter to his father (1919) addresses the consequences of the German-Jewish drive for assimilation that gained momentum in the latter half of the 19th century. Peter Weiss’s autobiographical novel Fluchtpunkt (1965) describes the experience of exile in Sweden during the Second World War. Rafael Seligmann’s novella Rubinsteins Versteigerung (1989) epitomises the paradox of being a German-Jew in Germany after the Holocaust. Barbara Honigmann’s autobiographical sketches in Damals, dann und danach (1999) reflect the continuing dislocation, linguistic and spatial, of contemporary German-Jewish subjects. Her work also provides insight into the experience of German-Jewish women and Jewish life in the GDR. Thematic points of emphasis throughout the course are: dominant and marginal cultures, assimilation, exile, the language of Jewish self-hatred, anti-Semitism, and generational change. A further question for discussion concerns how we might define German-Jewish writing.

Module Content:
»Moi, je ne suis pas marxiste« (»Ich meinerseits bin kein Marxist«). So hat sich ein gewisser Karl Heinrich Marx in einem privaten Gespräch mit seinem Schwiegersohn Paul Lafargue geäußert. Nach dem Zerfall der Sowjetunion im Jahr 1991 bestand in der abendländischen Mainstreamkultur Einmütigkeit darüber, es sei geradezu pervers, sich nunmehr als Marxist zu bezeichnen. In den letzten Jahren jedoch, und erst recht seit der verheerenden Weltwirtschaftskrise von 2007-8, hat das Gedankengut von Marx ein kurioses Comeback gemacht.
In diesem Seminar setzen wir uns die eminent germanistische Priorität, uns intensiv und kritisch mit einer Auswahl an Marx’ eigenen bahnbrechenden Schriften zu befassen. Was ist Marx’ Menschenbild? Warum und wie will er die Philosophie und die (liberal-bürgerliche) politische Ökonomie revolutionieren? Worauf beruht seine Kritik am Kapitalismus? Was genau versteht er unter Sozialismus bzw. Kommunismus? Wie unterscheidet er sich darin von anderen Sozialisten seiner Zeit? Welche Rolle hat sein Freund und Mitstreiter Friedrich Engels in der Entwicklung—und Verbreitung—seiner Ideen gespielt? Warum hat Marx in letzter Zeit so unerwartet an Prestige gewonnen? Und nicht zuletzt: Wie könnte eine Lektüre marxscher Texte unser Verständnis von Kultur, Gesellschaft, Religion und Kunst vertiefen?

Module Content:
If anyone has claim to be the Godfather of modern fantasy, horror and science fiction—not to mention the detective story—then it is surely the writer, composer, critic and artist Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (1776-1822). In this seminar we will immerse ourselves in a diverse selection of Hoffmann’s shorter tales, which represent a gloriously weird and macabre flowering of the German Dark-Romantic spirit.
Ghosts, automatons, doppelgänger, mesmerism, mania, magic, murder: small wonder that the influence of this explorer of the uncanny antagonisms of social life, and the ‘night’ side of the human psyche, can be felt in the works of such later luminaries as Charles Dickens, Hans Christian Andersen, Nikolai Gogol, Edgar Allan Poe, Emily Brontë, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Lewis Carroll, Sigmund Freud, Franz Kafka, Fritz Lang, Daphne du Maurier, Alfred Hitchcock, Günter Grass, Angela Carter, Cornelia Funke and Stephen King.

Module Content:
Emerging from the major financial challenges of unification and against global trends, the German economy has been thriving since the turn of the millennium. Yet recent and contemporary German-language literature and film has tended to feature the “new economy”, or neoliberal capitalism as it is also known, as highly problematic, a global force that has been eroding the fabric of local and individual everyday life since the fall of the Wall. In their works, German-language writers and filmmakers scratch the surface of wealthy Germany (and by implication the wealthy West), exposing the extreme pressures and affective realities that new economy capitalism bring to bear on the worker-consumer. The primary texts and films on the course offer a differentiated overview of this critical field of cultural production. They cover topics such as: the financial aftermath of unification and the spectre of the GDR in contemporary capitalist Germany (Petzold, Hein, Bauder); the commercialisation of Holocaust memory in the Berlin Republic (Hanika); the precariousness of existence as a white-collar employee of a multinational company (Röggla, Mora, Losmann); global high finance and the global city (Hochhäusler); new neoliberal identities, such as the “entrepreneurial self” (Nawrat). Secondary literature and theoretical texts will include reflection on: the defining features of neoliberal capitalism; the corrosion of character in the new economy; time and 24/7 culture in the digital era; the abstraction of finance capitalism and the question of how to represent it in film / literature; place, non-place and the body.

• to develop skills of research and critical analysis for oral presentation in class;
• to develop group-work skills in class discussion.
Module Content:
Emerging from the major financial challenges of unification and against global trends, the German economy has been thriving since the turn of the millennium. Yet recent and contemporary German-language literature and film has tended to feature the “new economy”, or neoliberal capitalism as it is also known, as highly problematic, a global force that has been eroding the fabric of local and individual everyday life since the fall of the Wall. In their works, German-language writers and filmmakers scratch the surface of wealthy Germany (and by implication the wealthy West), exposing the extreme pressures and affective realities that new economy capitalism bring to bear on the worker-consumer. The primary texts and films on the course offer a differentiated overview of this critical field of cultural production. They cover topics such as: the financial aftermath of unification and the spectre of the GDR in contemporary capitalist Germany (Petzold, Hein, Bauder); the commercialisation of Holocaust memory in the Berlin Republic (Hanika); the precariousness of existence as a white-collar employee of a multinational company (Röggla, Mora, Losmann); global high finance and the global city (Hochhäusler); new neoliberal identities, such as the “entrepreneurial self” (Nawrat). Secondary literature and theoretical texts will include reflection on: the defining features of neoliberal capitalism; the corrosion of character in the new economy; time and 24/7 culture in the digital era; the abstraction of finance capitalism and the question of how to represent it in film / literature; place, non-place and the body.

Module Content:
It is widely forgotten that between the 1880s and the First World War, the German Kaiserreich was among the colonial powers of Europe, occupying e.g. the territories that are known as Namibia, Cameroon, Togo, and Tanzania in Africa nowadays, along with New Guinea in the Pacific and the Chinese city of Qingdao. In the case of Austria-Hungary, however, the mantra of Habsburg historiography remains that this empire was not an colonizer (overseas) - but maybe it was within the continent or, at least, in its own imagination. Strange is the case of Switzerland, too, which as trade superpower was an important facilitator of European colonialism, but abstained from colonial conquest itself.
All of this has left traces in literature, be they affirmative or critical, which will be investigated in our Option seminar: examples of colonial as well as of postcolonial writing between 1900 and our present, with some prominent authors and some lesser known. In a first step, Postcolonialism as one of the major contemporary approaches to literary and cultural studies are introduced, before the literary texts of our corpus will be discussed (extracts and whole books). Students are required to give a presentation in Postcolonial theory as well as on one of the literary texts, ending in a research paper of their own choice.

Module Content:
This seminar shows the unique relationship German culture has with the wolf as a metaphor in the context of politics from the Middle Ages until today. Embarking from the specifically Germanic medieval concept of the criminal outlaw as wolf (vargr), it traces the ways in which this figure transforms over time, epitomizing different and shifting cultural anxieties, from religious and superstitious fears to psychological and racial ones. The trajectory of this course follows the wolf as a metaphor for greed and foolishness, for despotic rulers, for women as witches, persecuted ethnic minorities, migrants, traumatized individuals, for nationalism and fascism, and those practising resistance against institutions of power.
The wolf stands for greed and clerical hypocrisy in medieval animal epics from the late twelfth century such as Heinrich der Glîchezâre’s Reinhart Fuchs. It becomes a religious metaphor for human sin – voraciousness, belligerence, idleness, vagrancy and crime – in the early modern age, for example, in Grimmelshausen’s picaresque novel Simplicius Simplicissimus (1668), and a catalyst for initiation rites in cautionary folktales. Fears of foreign invasion are voiced through the image of wolves in Heinrich von Kleist’s Hermannsschlacht (1808), and the presence of Gypsies, Jews, and purported witches perceived as predatory wolves becomes the cause of communal anxieties, persecution, and abandonment in selected prose by Wilhelm Raabe, while a seventeenth-century farming community called the Wehrwölfe fend off Gypsies in Hermann Löns’s extremely racist novel Der Wehrwolf (1910). As an internalized psychic condition the wolf denotes oedipal neurosis in Sigmund Freud’s famous case study (1918) and becomes prominent in Herman Hesse’s Steppenwolf. How was the wolf image perceived in Nazi Germany, and how is it still a metaphor for fascism and nationalism in places like Germany Russia, and Turkey today? In Günter Grass’s Hundejahre (1963) the wolf stands allegorically for race, breeding, and a catalyst for the representation of perpetrators and victims. We will analyze the various manifestations and functions of this metaphor caught between hatred and veneration, look at one film, and at literature in a comparative (Stoker, Carter, Tournier) and environmental context in view of the reappearance of wolves in Germany and the lower 48 states in the US. A particular focus of this seminar will be the wolf metaphor in the context of race, gender, exile, and migration.

Machiavelli and Castiglione. The modern reflection on politics and historiography would be unthinkable without Niccolò Machiavelli’s treatise On the Princedoms or The Prince. The first half of the component sets the work in its historical context (clarifying the story of ‘Machiavellism’ in the Anglophone world) and offers a reading of the work’s key questions at stake: the nature of princedoms, the figure of the prince, his behaviour, fortune, etc.
The second half of the component is devoted to reading Baldassarre Castiglione's Libro del Cortegiano (1528): a Renaissance dialogue set at the court of Urbino, it was translated into many languages and became enormously influential not only in defining the role of the courtier (whose modern descendants include the gentleman, the political advisor and the arbiter of taste) but also in suggesting images of the good life, the art of conversation and the spiritual nature of beauty.

IT3411,Italian Option: Italian Drama 1470S-1530S,Corinna Salvadori,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module, students should be able to do research-based project work on Early Modern Theatre in Italy, explaining and corroborating their interpretations of the prescribed dramatic works, with some evaluation of relevant scholarship; analyse some interactions of culture and history in Italy; trace and document valid comparisons between these texts and ones by the same authors prescribed in the core course, and present their knowledge in essays that display an understanding of literary and dramatic techniques, and of critical approaches to dramatic works.
Module Learning Aims:
To acquire some understanding of comedy as a genre, to place early Italian dramatic works in a wider European context, with an understanding of Italy’s unique legacy to this.
Module Content:
Plautus and Terence, performed in Latin and in translation, paved the way for plays in vernacular in the most important cultural centres in Italy, and some of these were a strong influence for the development of drama elsewhere in Europe. This option offers students a guided tour through some of those early dramatic forms, quite different from each other, that led to the establishing of drama as entertainment. Poliziano’s short Fabula d’Orfeo, the first dramatic work on a secular theme, performed in Mantua 1478-1480, was to lead to Monteverdi’s opera. Lorenzo de’ Medici’s Rappresentazione di San Giovanni e Paolo, performed in Florence in February 1491, offers an unique insight, for its time, in the moral conflict that assails a ruler torn between his conscience and what is strategically best for the state. Ludovico Ariosto had the first custom-built, Vitruvius inspired theatre at the court of the Este in Ferrara; his plays are remarkable for their characterisation and moral satire and we shall discuss La Lena (1528/1529). Time permitting, Niccolò Machiavelli’s Mandragola (1518/1526), a comedy perhaps best called a ‘tragedy’, and / or Gli ingannati, Siena, 1531, one of the sources for Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, will be included. All of these plays have good translations into English and a feature of the option will be assessing the translations as performable texts.

IT3412,Italian Option: Posthumanism In Contemporary Literature,Enrica Ferrara,"Learning Outcomes:
On the successful completion of this module, students will be able to express their knowledge and display a critical understanding of some or all concepts covered; the double and the binary imagination; the difference between transhumanism and posthumanism; posthuman figurations of gender and race; performative posthumanism and new materialism, with reference to the texts studied.
Module Learning Aims:
This course aims to explore the theme of posthumanism in Italian Literature through a comparative approach that will link the analysis of Twentieth-Century Italian texts by authors such as Vittorini and Calvino to classic works of the Gothic tradition, such as Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1818) and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886) by Robert Louis Stevenson.
Module Content:
We will witness the transition from a dualistic and binary understanding of the human to an attempt at hybridizing the margins between what is human and what is not in novels such as Men and Not Men (1945) by Elio Vittorini and The Non-Existent Knight (1959) by Italo Calvino. Finally, after illustrating the posthuman turn of the 1960’s and 1970’s, we will explore the construction of new narrative subject-identities in which the boundaries with environmental otherness (Tiziano Scarpa, Stabat Mater, 2008) sexualized and animal otherness (Elena Ferrante, The Days of Abandonment, 2002) and racial otherness (Amara Lakhous, Clash of Civilizations Over an Elevator in Piazza Vittorio, 2006) are definitely blurred.

IT3413,Italian Option: Italian Option: Italian Cinema: 1900-2018,Clodagh Brook,"Learning Outcomes:

They will have gained an overview of Italian cinema history, including some of its key movements and directors. They will be able to reflect on what they have learned. They will be able to express their understanding and knowledge through essays that display a critical understanding of the material studied and a basic understanding of film techniques.
Module Learning Aims:
This module aims to introduce and critically assess Italy’s cinema history 1900-2018 through a series of films which best represent the periods in question. It will also introduce students to basic film techniques.
Module Content:
Italian cinema is one of the world’s richest, most influential and fascinating. This module opens with the earliest short silent films, capturing the first coffee ever drunk on screen and a papal wave; we analyze too an extraordinary silent epic, which influenced cinema across the developed world. The next step is to understand fascism’s hold over cinema (1922-1945). We investigate how a dictatorship builds consensus through film, but also how, and why, it fails. Immediately after the war, Italian Neorealist cinema stands the camera in front of ordinary Italian lives and the ruins of Italy’s devastated cities: what gritty realism means in these circumstances, and how it works, is discussed in lectures. Next, the so-called Golden Age of Italian cinema (1960s) provides us with Italian cinema’s biggest names (Fellini, Bertolucci, Pasolini, Antonioni): highly creative, unconventional and artistic auteurs, whose work had a huge global impact. The final lectures are dedicated to contemporary cinema (2000-2018), including Italy’s recent successes with television series like Sorrentino’s The Young Pope.

IT3415,Italian Option: Writing The Unwritten: Intellectual Commitment In 20Th-Cent. Italy,,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module, students should be able to do advanced study and research-based project work on a number of texts, explaining and corroborating their interpretations of those texts, with some evaluation of relevant scholarship; communicate an understanding of authorship as a component of literary culture; analyse some interactions of culture and history in Italy; trace and document valid comparisons between texts, and convey a broad understanding of continuities, connections and contradictions in Italian literature and culture; present their knowledge in commentaries and essays that display an understanding of literary techniques and critical approaches.
Module Learning Aims:
To examine a slice of Italian history from the Fascist period to the late Seventies through a number of literary and cinematic texts which show the development of the concept of intellectual commitment or “impegno”.
Module Content:
The discussion of novels by Elio Vittorini which emphasize the need to challenge the Fascist status-quo. As intellectuals are called by Vittorini to “write the unwritten” martyrs of Mussolini’s imperialistic war and demolish the icons of power built by Fascist propaganda, many artists and writers will follow on in his footsteps in the post-war period. Through analysis of Gli occhiali d’oro by Giorgo Bassani, we will observe how the author tackles issues of memory politics in the representation of queer and Jewish identity during the Fascist period.

IT3418,Italian Option: Gendered Narratives In 20Th Century Italian Literature,,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:
• Understand and analyze a variety of texts from contemporary Italian literature that deal with representation of gender identity;
• Contextualize the representation of gender identity to the historical period in which the narrative texts were produced;
• Trace and document valid comparisons between texts, explaining and corroborating their interpretations of those texts, with some evaluation of relevant scholarship;
• Present their knowledge in essays that display an understanding of literary techniques and critical approaches.
Module Learning Aims:
This module aims at exploring the representation of gender in 20th Century Italian Literature with a particular focus on the re-shaping of gendered narrative subjects and topics of discourse in the post-fascist era.
Module Content:
The model of masculinity promoted during the Fascist regime resulted in a narrative model which would predominantly, but not exclusively, act as a mirror to a male-centred society in which other genders ended up being relegated in a liminal position. In a post-war society which still appears to be largely dominated by Fascist prejudice in matters of gender, several narrative texts by authors such as Anna Banti, Natalia Ginzburg, Cesare Pavese, Giorgio Bassani and Pier Paolo Pasolini, contribute to re-define the perception of gender both through a performative construction of the narrative subject identity as well as by identifying and sometimes challenging gender stereotypes.

On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:

• Present the results of their study through classroom discussions and presentations, and a coherent written essay making proper use of published sources.
• Reflect on the relationship of their optional modules to the core language and literature modules in Italian.
Module Learning Aims:
Through a close analysis of Calvino’s narrative this course will pose a number of questions about Calvino’s playful experimentation with literature and its devices and will ultimately try to address the issue of this author’s “trasformismo” as a tool to disguise and escape his own loss of intellectual identity.
Module Content:
The course will focus on Italo Calvino’s narrative from the late Fifties to the Eighties and will explore the author’s ability to experiment with a variety of styles and even to create new “hybrid” literary genres. From the allegorical fairy tale of The Baron in the Trees to the historical and allegorical dialogue of a text full of symbolism like The Invisible Cities, from the contamination of graphic art and mythical imagery of The Castle of Crossed Destinies to that archetype of Italian post-modern writing which is If on a winter night a traveller, Calvino’s texts are the testimony of a continuous search of identity.

Module Content:
The students will be offered a panorama pointing out some milestones of this still very fertile tradition: from the 17th century teatro d’opera – one of the most important musical novelties in Italy and in Europe (Alessandro Striggio and Monteverdi, some dramatization of famous literary episodes such as Chi soffre speri from Boccaccio (1637), music by Virgilio Mazzocchi and Marco Marazzoli, La catena d’Adone from Marino (1626) and the Ritorno d’Angelica nell’Indie from Ariosto (1632), music by Tronsarelli) – to 18th century Arcadian and Neoclassical musical artefacts such as: intermezzo (La serva padrona (1733), music by Pergolesi), melodramma (Metastasio’s La clemenza di Tito (1734), music by Mozart), dramma giocoso (Da Ponte’s libretto Le nozze di Figaro (1786), music by Mozart). The 19th century brings revolutionary ideas and rise of Romanticism; its musical production will be analysed in two major aspects: Rossini’s opera comica (Il barbiere di Siviglia, 1816, libretto by Cesare Sterbini) and Verdi’s Shakespearian legacy (Otello, 1887, libretto by Arrigo Boito; Falstaff, 1893, libretto by Arrigo Boito) and political engagement against the backdrop of the Risorgimento (Nabucco, 1842, libretto by Temistocle Solera). Then, jumping into the contemporary era the course will focus on the current situation of the libretto tradition, looking at Edoardo Sanguineti’ s Passaggio with music by Luciano Berio (1963); Un re in ascolto (1983), an opera by Luciano Berio whose libretto is based on a short story of the same name written by Italo Calvino in 1982; and Emilio Villa’s I miei tarocchi with music by Cosimo Leonardo Colazzo (2016). Clips, tapes, movies, an operatic soprano and a musician will be involved in the classes.

IT7008,Cultures And Representation Of The Mafia,,"Learning Outcomes:
The students will learn the fundamentals about Italian original mafias and current international mafias (USA, Russian, Mexican, Japanese, etc.) and the anti-Mafia legal methods and strategies for contrasting it. They will be able to distinguish between the main mafias in Italy and in the rest of the world. The students should be able to understand the actual and current complexity, seriousness, danger and pervasiveness of the Mafia as a global phenomenon literally affecting each of us beyond our own awareness. The student should become familiar with different theories and critical instruments in order to deal with such a complex problem. They should develop a sense of criticism and a civil and social conscience about the problem learning the basics of different cultural theories.
Module Learning Aims:
The above fundamentals will become familiar to the students through a spectrum of different methodologies and approaches involving history; religion; ethics; anthropology, rhetoric, persuasion and reception theory; languages codes and symbols; law and investigation techniques; economics and the global financial market. The material of reference is made of books and essays on history, anthropology, sociology, rhetoric, pedagogy; updated journalistic reports and investigation cases; films, documentaries, TV series, theatrical pieces, popular songs on the Mafia. Selected texts are explored in depth. Close-reading of poignant texts (both written and audio-visual) is made in class. Confrontations and contrasts within the different mafias and with the antimafia systems and strategies are continuously discussed. The varied theoretical and methodological approaches are introduced, applied and debated. Rather than attempting an exhaustive treatment of a vast topic, the course aims to provide students with examples of how mafia and antimafia operate at different levels, in the hope that some of the interpretive tools employed may prove useful in the students’ own research.
A comparative perspective is emphasised throughout; while some lectures are internally structured around comparison, it is intended that students will also be able to forge illuminating links between lectures, and indeed between material from this option and that studied on other courses. The notion of translation and of cultural translation in its broader sense of moving between cultures is addressed on several levels. In practical terms, where texts studied were not originally written in English, specific problems with their interpretation may be discussed. More conceptually, students contemplate the difficulties of translating and dealing with problems across cultures. Finally, they are invited to reflect on the ‘transplant’ across different languages, cultures and time. The aim of the course is to make students more aware of our society providing them with fundamental cultural tools and eliciting in them a stronger individual and civil concern and a deeper sense of critical capability towards important phenomena of our current society and financial global world.
Module Content:
WEEK ONE: Historical and theoretical introduction

Lecturer: Prof. Giuliana Adamo (Department of Italian, TCD)
This initial class offers a historical overview of the origin of Mafia in the second half of XIXth century in Southern Italy, which ran in parallel to the accomplishment of the Risorgimento process that led to the geographical and political unification of Italy in 1861. This class will also focus on the word ‘mafia’, its etymology and meanings. The concept of ‘mafia’ will be introduced, defined and explained as a mirror of a traditional society, as an enterprise, organization, and in terms of the juridical system. Some historical, anthropological, sociological, linguistic approaches are used. The purpose of this class is to equip students with a broad awareness both of the chronological, historical and geographical contexts in which the phenomenon was created, and with theoretical tools with which to engage with the texts offered in bibliography.

Selected texts:
Dickie, John, Cosa Nostra: A History of the Sicilian Mafia (Hodder Paperbacks: 2007)
Nicaso, Antonio, La mafia spiegata ai ragazzi (Mondadori: Milano, 2010)
Films: 1860 (1934) by Alessandro Blasetti and Il gattopardo (The Leopard) (1963) by Luchino Visconti (both on the Risorgimento and its achievement of the unification of Italy in 1861). In nome della legge (In the name of the Law) (1949) by Elio Petri (on local mafia and the juridical system.) 
WEEK TWO:   The four Italian mafias: Cosa Nostra, Camorra, ‘Ndrangheta, Sacra Corona Unita
Lecturer: Prof. Giuliana Adamo

This class offers an historical, anthropological, sociological overview on the four Italian mafias respectively set in Sicily, Campania, Calabria and Apulia. The Sicilian mafia, or Cosa Nostra, is far from being Italy's only dangerous criminal fraternity. The south of the country hosts two other major mafias: the camorra, from Naples and its hinterland; and the 'ndrangheta, the mafia from the poor and isolated region of Calabria that has now risen to become the most powerful mob of all. Furthermore from Apulia comes the youngest of Italian mafia: Sacra Corona Unita. Each of these brotherhoods has its own methods, its own dark rituals, its own style of ferocity and corruption. Their early history is little known; indeed some of it has been entirely shrouded in myth and silence. Differences and continuity amongst them are explored in relation to their respective rituals of initiation and affiliation, territory and population control, power, violence, secrecy, symbolic codes and behaviors. Problems related to the importance of family, maternity and the role of women in the male-centered Mafia systems are considered in some detail. Some light is also cast on the relationship between mafia and religion, and on the nature and function of the godfathers. Some reflections are devoted to Machiavelli's lucid analysis of the workings of power and of the necessity of understanding and using them as a tool to examine the political logics of Mafia power.

WEEK THREE:  From Sicily to US: the Italian and American Mafia

Lecturer: Prof. Giuliana Adamo

This class offers a historical retrospective on the exportation, germination, blossoming and development of the Sicilian mafia in U.S. from the origin to the present state. Magnates, politicians, drug traffickers, clerics, and public figures populate the history of the Sicilian Mafia. This class shows and analyzes how, instead of merely being an amalgamation of episodes of organized crime, the history of the Sicilian Mafia is dense with political and social implications. Analyzing historical documents, this class examines the criminal processes that originated in Italy and, through formal and informal alliances, have spread to the international community. Differences and continuities, alliances and wars between mafias are discussed and also anti-mafia methods for contrasting them.

WEEK FOUR:   Mafia and antimafia in war: the recent and current situation in Italy. Reflections on Mafia and Politics 

Lecturer: Prof . Giuliana Adamo

This class examines the war in the last decades of the XXth between the Sicilian Cosa Nostra and the Italian State culminating with the assassination of the two most popular anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992. The aftermath of these killings led to a sea-change in Italy, sparking a massive popular collective reaction against mafia activities. This class will also examines some of the anti-mafia laws passed (and still in force today) by the Italian Parliament, their realization achieved by the Italian magistrates, and the Police investigation strategies and techniques. This class also focuses on the relationship between mafia and politics.

Selected texts:

WEEK SIX: On current Italian and International Mafia phenomena: some cases and samples of crime and punishment

Lecturer: Prof. Arcangelo Badolati (University of Calabria, ‘ndrangheta expert, writer, journalist)

WEEK SEVEN: READING WEEK  

WEEK EIGHT: On the Mafia popular myth: the Made Men

Lecturer: Prof. Antonio Nicaso (Middlebury College (VT, USA), University of Calabria, writer, essayist, world known expert on organized crime)

The novel The Godfather (1969) and the movie of the same name (1972) entrenched the myth of the Mafiosi as valiant knights, men of honor, and defenders of the traditional concept of family. This class demystifies this image by dismantling the code of honor that Mafiosi live by, including its attendant symbols, rituals, and the lifestyle that it demands.
Since the end of World War II to the present, the mafia in Italy and America has undergone major changes. This class considers all kinds of related organizations, not only the Italian ones, including the Yakuza, the Triads, and the Russian Mafia. This class looks at organized criminal culture in general, attempting to explain why its symbols, rituals, and practices continue to draw people in, both as literal members, or as consumers of the pop culture that glorifies them. This class traces and decodes the origins, history and success of the mafia in the U.S., bringing a better, and more accurate understanding of this ultimately brutal, violent, and corrupting “family business.”

Selected texts:

Eco, Umberto, Trattato di semiotica generale (1975). Engl. Trans. A Theory of Semiotics (1976)

Nicaso, Antonio and Marcel Danesi, Made Men, Mafia culture and the Power of Symbols, Rituals, and Myth (2013).

WEEK NINE: Mafia and theatre

Lecturer: Dr Brenda Donohue

The first recorded instance of the written use of the word ""mafia"" was in Giuseppe Rizzotto and Gaspare Mosca's 1836 play  I mafiusi della Vicaria.Since this first treatment of the organisation, theatrical representation has variously acted as a medium for the propagation of the mafia myth and as a tool in the popular resistance to it. Through the lens of a number of theatrical texts and performance events from writers such as Rizzotto and Mosca, Leonardo Sciascia, and more recently Augusto Boal, Emma Dante and Roberto Saviano, the class examines the ways in which theatre has at times resisted the mafia, and at others, promoted its mentality.

Selected Texts:

Boal, Augusto. Games for Actors and Non-Actors. Routledge: London & New York, 1992. 19-28.

WEEK TEN: Mafia and literature

Lecturer: Prof. Giuliana Adamo

This class will focus on how the Mafia phenomenon is discussed and (mis-)represented in some very well known literary texts both Italian and not.

Selected texts:

Bonanno, Joseph A Man of Honor. The Autobiography of Joseph Bonanno (1983) (now: Mass Market Paperback – Reprint). Also available on line (free download), see: http://findpdf.net/about-a-man-of-honor-joseph-bonanno-download.html

WEEK TWELVE: Conclusive point on Antimafia. 

Lecturer: Prof. Marcello Ravveduto (University of Salerno, historian of mafia, writer)

This class focuses on some anti-mafia recent and current experiences. From the exemplar case of Libero Grassi, to the creation of the Anti Racket and Addiopizzo movements. This class also indulges on the courageous activities of two current anti-mafia magistrates: Nicola Gratteri working in the Reggio Calabria tribunal against ‘ndrangheta and Antonino Di Matteo working in the Palermo tribunal against Cosa nostra. Furthermore this class hints to the action of some valuable priests (particularly Don Ciotti and his anti-mafia association Libera).

IT7010,Discovering The Other: East-West Encounters In Translation History,,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:
• Recognise the historical and cultural backdrop to translation traditions and attitudes to be found today in East Asia and Western Europe.
• Discuss the developing role and impact of translation(s) on the political, cultural, and technological development of identified cultural contexts.
• Discuss the changing conceptions of translation in the context of specific historical moments.
• Recognise the often radically different conceptions of translation, uses for translation, and roles of translators, and how these function in context.
• Articulate informed views about key primary sources and scholarship the field of translation theory in academically appropriate language.
• Critically discuss the lasting impact of named translators over their linguistic contexts.
Module Learning Aims:
This module examines the history of translation between East Asia and the English language world from the mid-nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. During this century, Europe, Japan, and China all saw unprecedented cultural, economical, technological, and political change. This was also the century when European nations first began to gain a proper understanding of East Asia, and when East Asia began to take an interest in Europe. Eventually, European and American cultures came to be seen in East Asia as societies to be emulated, while East Asian cultures were seen in Europe and America as highly exotic, impenetrable mysteries. This module examines the lives and works of some of the most outstanding translators of this period in the context of the impact their translation activities had over their home cultures.
From the Japanese context, it examines: Fukuzawa Yukichi, and Mori Ōgai. From the Chinese context, it examines: Yan Fu, Lin Shu, and Fu Lei. From the context of the English language, it examines: Ernest Satow, Lafcadio Hearn, Ezra Pound, and Arthur Waley. Throughout the module, we see how each culture developed its lasting understanding of the cultural Other, and consider how and whether this understanding continues to inform intercultural communication today.
Module Content:
Each week, a sample of reading is provided on the subject in question. This functions as an introduction to the subject, and as a start-point for discussion. Small groups of students will also briefly present further information and perspectives they have acquired through reading further around the topic at hand, such as the lasting impact of the translator in question, the historical backdrop of their work, and any impact it has for translation theory.

IT7011,Interlingual Technologies,,"Learning Outcomes:
Specific themes to be addressed include:
• Automatic Translation, its development and impact.
• Computer Aided Translation Tools, their current role in the translation industry, the global leaders, and how to use them.
• Localisation, its roles and impact on website, product, and media development.
• The mechanics of dubbing and sub-titling.
• The effect of emerging technologies on literary translation.
Module Learning Aims:
The vast majority of translators working in the twenty-first century rely to some extent on interlingual technologies for their work. These technologies are also employed by large numbers of other professionals and researchers who do not identify themselves primarily as translators. This module gives students an overview of the range of computer-based tools available to language-specialists today, their evolution over recent years, and the directions in which they are likely to develop in the future. As well as gaining an understanding of the theoretical mechanics of these technologies and their relationships with a variety of industries, students gain hands-on experience of using a wide range of interlingual tools in the module’s targeted workshops. Students taking this module should be confident in their ability to use at least two languages.
Module Content:
This module combines practical lab sessions with more theoretical seminar sessions. Each session focuses on a different aspect of interlingual technology and moves quickly to provide students with a foundational introduction to each tool. Students are expected to spend substantial time in self-guided study, familiarising themselves with the tools and using them, so as to reach proficiency.

IT7013,Theory And History Of Translation,,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:
• Recognise key ‘turns’ in the history of translation theory (the Classics, the Medieval and Early Modern periods, the Renaissance, Romantic Germany, Modernity)
• Discuss the changing conceptions of translation in the context of specific historical moments.
• Recognise key theoretical questions posed by translation (such as notions of betrayal, fidelity, literary meaning, originality, textuality) and examine them through the prism of a specific text or series of texts.
• Articulate informed views about key primary sources and scholarship the field of translation theory in academically appropriate language.
• Critically discuss the relationship between the theory and practice of translation with reference to a text or group of texts selected for inclusion in the student’s translation portfolio or dissertation.
Module Learning Aims:
This module examines the relationship between the theory and practice of translation by focusing on the history of the theories of translation. The aim of the module is two-fold: on the one hand, to explore some of the more pressing theoretical questions posed by translation (such as, notions of betrayal, fidelity, literary meaning, originality, textuality, etc.); on the other hand, to understand the changing conceptions of translation in the context of a specific historical moment (the Classics, the Medieval and Early Modern periods, the Renaissance, Romantic Germany, Modernity). On a local level, each session will look at a key moment in the history of translation theory, by examining a particular set of theoretical questions through the prism of a specific text (or series of texts). On a broader level, the module will reflect on the ways in which the theoretical questions posed by translation and the approaches adopted to engage with these questions evolve in different historical moments and cultural contexts.
Module Content:
The course will follow Venuti’s The Translation Studies Reader, moving from Classical Antiquity, through the Medieval and Early Modern Periods, the Renaissance, Romantic Germany, Russian Formalism, Deconstruction, to the Modern age.

IT7014,Aspects Of The Profession,,"Learning Outcomes:
Students are expected to
- gain an insight into the profession of literary translation, including processes of editing, publishing, marketing, promotion, and reviewing;
- understand that beyond the delights of translating literature there lie serious challenges involved in getting their translations published;
- thus form a realistic image of what to expect from the profession;
- gain hands-on experience with the profession by being exposed to the work of our translator-in-residence, his/her country/language specific market challenges;
- critically discuss their experience with these practitioners by way of a written journal.
Module Learning Aims:
The aims of the module include the following: to provide students with an overall knowledge of the practical implications in the field of literary translation; to equip them with the ability to assess career possibilities in literary translation; to allow them insight into the editing process, the market realities, the professional networks available to literary translators, and career opportunities.
Module Content:
The module will consist of a series of lectures given by prominent people in the field of literary translation and the world of publishing. These may include but are not limited to publishers, editors, directors of literary translation centres and associations, as well as prominent practitioners. There will be an average of three to four lectures each HT. The lectures are accompanied by a seminar with the translator-in-residence who is invited from a different country each year. The seminar topic typically builds on the translator’s experience and expertise, and will provide an insight into his language-specific work, his career path, and the market for translations in his or her specific area and location. It is envisioned to invite translators from China, Mexico, Brazil, India, and Japan in the coming years.

IT7017,"Trauma In Translation: Representations, Rewritings, Adaptations",Thomas Brown,"Learning Outcomes:
Upon successful completion of the module students should be able to:
1. develop their textual competence by analysing, interpreting and evaluating key primary and secondary sources in the field of translation studies, trauma studies, and cultural memory;
2. identify culture- and history-specific elements of both source and target texts by analysing and researching conceptions of translation, rewriting and adaptation that formulated in specific historical, political and cultural contexts;
3. develop their intercultural and intertextual skills by engaging with texts and translations from different cultures, languages, and historical periods;
4. evaluate a variety of translations and adaptations produced in different historical contexts;
5. critically appraise the relationship between aesthetics and ethics of translation and the concept of translator as witness and translation as testimony.
Module Learning Aims:
The module aims to acquaint students with key theoretical concepts relating to the representation, translation and adaptation of traumatic past. It aims to explore artistic responses to historical traumas, alongside questions of memory, memorialisation, trauma, and witnessing. It helps students develop skills of close-reading, critical analysis, interpretation and argumentation. It encourages them to analyse, interpret, and critically evaluate translations and adaptations of literary texts of various genres, including theatre and film adaptations. In their essays students explore their own research interests in the field: these could include the genres of slave narratives, migrant fiction, war poetry, or refugee writing.
Module Content:
This module explores how trauma and traumatic past is represented, translated and rewritten in literary texts of different genres, including theatre and film adaptations. It focuses on the questions of the role and responsibility of the translator, the relationship between aesthetics and ethics, and the complex connection between literature, translation and cultural memory. Through close attention to the voices of those living with trauma, the module provides a reflection on cultural history that continues to shape our responses to different forms of prejudice, racism and violence against the other.
The module is divided into four thematic blocks:
1) The module begins by examining the question of translation and rewriting in colonial and postcolonial contexts (Angela Carter’s and J.M. Coetzee’s rewritings of Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, as well as two film adaptations of Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness).
2) In the second part of the module, translations and film adaptations of narratives addressing totalitarianism and the experience of communism and post-communist transition are considered (Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Herta Müller, Zlatko Dizdarevic).
3) The third part of the module focuses on the Holocaust and how it is represented in works of different genres (poetry, narrative prose, graphic novel) by first- and second-generation survivors (Tadeusz Borowski, Paul Celan, Art Spiegelman).
4) The module concludes by exploring texts related to the present-day refugee and migration crisis and the issue of human rights violation. We look at translated poetry volumes that capture the experience of refugees, detainees, and people living in war-stricken areas (Maram al-Masri’s Liberty Walks Naked and Frank Smith’s Guantanamo).

Describe the relationship between ancient Israel and the kingdom of Moab

Appreciate the importance of oral tradition and ritual in the construction of identity

Discuss the diversity of Jewish thinking in the first century

Analyse the Jewish background of the Jesus movement


 
Module Learning Aims:
This module is compulsory for Junior Freshman students. It is also suitable for visiting students. It aims to introduce students to the problems of using ancient sources (the Bible, ancient inscriptions and art and archaeology) to reconstruct the origins of early Israelite history and religion up until and including the emergence of the Jesus movement in the Jewish environment of Judea under Roman rule.

 
Module Content:
 
The first half of the module examines a variety of inscriptions and other material evidence from the environment of ancient Israel which may help to elucidate the world of the Biblical texts. For example, the Mesha Inscription from the ancient kingdom of Moab is examined and compared to the biblical account of wars with Moab in the book of Judges. Also explored is the importance of writing in ancient Israel and in the ancient Near Eastern world of Israel’s neighbours. How important were written records? Were the identities and self-understandings of the ancient societies more deeply rooted in oral tradition and if so how can we begin to explore their religions and cultures? The second part of the course looks at the emergence of the Jesus movement within the Jewish world of first century Palestine. Topics covered included Jesus and Jewish tradition, Jesus and Torah, Jesus and the Temple and Jesus and first century Jewish sects.
