BCLAW,Introduction To Criminal Law,David Prendergast,"Learning Outcomes:
Having successfully completed this module, students should be able to:

Identify criminal laws by using primary materials such as statutes and appellate court judgments;

Apply criminal law doctrine, precedent, and statute for the purpose of assessing criminal liability;

Critically analyse substantive criminal law;

Engage in detailed critical discussion of the offences of murder, manslaughter, and rape, as well defences to these offences;

Research, reason, and write in the style of criminal law lawyers.
Module Learning Aims:
This module will introduce the main features of the criminal law system and the operation of criminal liability.
Module Content:
The module is both practical and theoretical. Practical in that you will develop skills to identify the criminal law on an area and apply it to factual scenarios. The module is theoretical in that you will explore and develop critical perspectives on various aspects of criminal law.
The focus is on substantive criminal law. Substantive criminal law refers to the definitions of specific offences and the operation of criminal liability. Substantive criminal law is distinguished from procedural criminal law. Procedural criminal law is the law governing the processes of trial and punishment for criminal wrongdoing. The Introduction to Criminal Law module will involve studying numerous judgments of the Irish courts (and those of England and Wales) in past criminal cases. Important cases from other jurisdictions will also feature. It should be noted that in studying criminal cases we read what the judges say about the law and its application in the case at hand. This means that the focus is not on questions of fact - such as who really committed the crime, the accuracy of forensic evidence, and so on - but rather on questions of law: whether it is murder to end the life of someone who is about to die anyway, whether you can be convicted for a crime you performed while intoxicated to such an extent you didn't know what you were doing, whether you can be punished for accidentally polluting a river and so on.
Much of Introduction to Criminal Law is concerned with how the law requires certain external events and certain states of mind as prerequisite for criminal guilt. This involves study of the doctrines and principles of criminal liability. There will be a special focus on defining and applying what are commonly considered to be the most serious offences in the criminal calendar: murder, manslaughter, and rape. The essential basics of criminal procedure and rules of evidence will be covered.

LA3471,English Land Law,,"Learning Outcomes:
Having successfully completed this module, students should be able to:

Deconstruct reforms in English land law to understand their policy goals and their strengths/weaknesses in achieving such goals;

Identify and assess the principal differences between English and Irish land law;

Locate the rules of English land law within domestic and international human rights contexts;

Identify and evaluate the range of remedies available in land law disputes;

Apply critical analysis and problem-solving skills and techniques to different essay and problem based exam questions on English land law.


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module grounds students in the major principles of English land law, with particular attention paid to those areas where English land law differs from Irish land law. It builds upon the foundational work done in Land Law by deepening students conceptual understanding of property as an institution, and of the competing policy goals that affect its development, particularly through statutory reform. It also seeks to improve students’ critical understanding of land law, and in particular of the interface between public and private law in the context of land. 

 
The course begins with an exploration of the foundational aspects of English land law. It considers the historical evolution of English land law, the impact of equity, and the understanding of ownership that it instantiates. In particular, the boundary between property rights and personal rights is critically assessed, and relativity of title in English land law is explored through the prism of the law of finders. 

The course then addresses the various estates in land recognised in English law and their key incidents, including detailed study of the leasehold estate and the option of holding freehold estates as commonhold, under the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002. The law relating to trusts and co-ownership is explored, particularly the changes introduced by Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996. The course then turns to consider the law relating to mortgages, easements and covenants, and the doctrine of adverse possession. 

 
A central focus throughout is the land registration system in England, and the priority rules arising out of that registration system. Students will be continuously exposed to the consequences of registration for dealings in relation to land, and to the divergent rules that apply to registered and unregistered estates and interests in land in the various topics covered in the course. The impact of e-conveyancing on these rules will also be considered. Finally, the impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 on English land law will be analysed in detail. The course will address the Act itself, the debate about impact that it generated amongst academics, and the evolving jurisprudence on the human rights implications of land law emanating from the courts in Strasbourg and England. In particular, the interaction between European human rights principles and English private law principles, and the dialogue it has prompted between the European Court of Human Rights and the English Supreme Court, will be critically assessed.

Evaluate the emerging developments in media law and regulation, including the use of non-legal governance;

Apply critical analysis and problem-solving skills and techniques to different essay and problem questions based on material covered in the module;

Conduct research into developing areas of media law and practice.
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This course will consider both the theoretical and practical questions which arise in this evolving area of the law. Initially, the course will examine the role of the media in a constitutional democracy. The constitutional protection of the media in Ireland will be compared with similar regimes in other jurisdictions with particular emphasis on the jurisprudence of the European Convention of Human Rights. The course will then address a number of specific areas of media law. Lectures will deal with topics such as defamation, privacy, contempt of court, the protection of journalistic sources, obscenity, blasphemy, and the regulatory regimes in Ireland and in the EU. Throughout the course lectures will explore the issues raised by the rise of new media forms like the internet.

LA3474,Critical Perspectives On Law,David Kenny,"Learning Outcomes:
At the end of this module, students should be able to:

Identify and categorise political and ideological assumptions that have been subsumed into legal doctrine

Describe and evaluate the appropriateness of grounding principles in the contemporary socio-economic context

Differentiate the sectoral interest groups that benefit and do not benefit from the legal status quo

Justify and defend principles with which they agree based on full evaluation of their applicability in the practical legal context

Appraise the extent to which the existing corpus of Irish law serves its ostensible goals.


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Doctrinal approaches to law are generally based on certain assumptions about human motivations and behaviour and the structure of society. Many of these grounding assumptions are rooted heavily in particular socio-political ideologies, most commonly those of 19th Century liberalism. Ideas about individual legal rights, justice and public policy have a strong tendency to assume a level of equality of power and opportunity that is wholly absent from the status quo in most developed economies.
The purpose of this module is to equip students to identify and critique the sacred cows of legal doctrine. By examining social context, economic realities and power relationships, the fallacies of many of the founding principles of core legal subjects will be deconstructed and evaluated. Students may ultimately conclude that these founding principles are sound or meritorious; however, whatever their conclusion, the process of critique and defence of fundamental elements of the legal order adds significantly to students’ understanding of the law.
The critique is primarily aimed at the core subjects that students will have studies during their Freshman modules. This ensures that students have sufficient background material. These subjects have also been chosen as they are the basis for the legal education of all professional lawyers in the state in that they are also the core subjects of the FE1 exams and the King’s Inns’ Diploma in Legal Studies.

Develop an awareness of the political and broader practical implications of constitutional litigation;

Understand the role of the constitutional litigant and litigator in legal practice.

 

 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Current Issues in Constitutional Law is a skills based course, designed to promote critical engagement by Sophister students with constitutional issues through close reading of major cases. Such cases, and complementary academic materials, will serve as a vehicle for exploring themes that run through constitutional law. The aim of this course is to deepen students’ knowledge and legal skills in constitutional law.

 
This course will adopt the reading group format, which focuses on collective text analysis and student-led discussion of principles, themes, and impacts of major constitutional decisions. Students are assigned advanced reading, including cases and academic commentaries, with one or two students chosen to deliver a springboard presentation each week, which will catalyse a class discussion on the issues raised by the assigned readings. The lecturers will act as facilitators, contributing opinions and posing questions to tease out additional issues and deeper analysis, but will eschew the ordinary lecture format. Essential to this format is a small group of students. As a result, student numbers will be capped at c. 20 students.

 
The key materials for the course will be prescribed decisions of the Irish Superior Courts, as well as academic materials on Irish and comparative constitutional law. The course will concentrate on topical issues, incorporating major developments in constitutional law on an on-going basis.

 
The focus of the course will be on thorough individual reading of major cases and group discussion and analysis, through which the class can collectively explore major themes in constitutional law. The course will enhance students’ research abilities, their critical analysis of legal materials, their legal writing, and their communication skills. It will challenge them to think about constitutional law at both the detailed micro level of discrete problems and the broader macro level of cross-cutting thematic issues.

 

Week-to-week, the course will be focused on particular themes. The following are illustrative of the sort of themes that will be discussed, but these may be adapted to reflect the latest developments and trends in the area, in particular new Superior Court decisions.

 

Social Policy and Rights; Distributive Justice

Group Rights

Enforcement of Rights, Remedies, Constitutional Lacunae

The Relationship Between Administrative Government and the Courts

Role of Interest Groups/ Oversight of Legislative Objectives

Trends in Court Jurisprudence - eras of the Court and shifting attitudes

New Issues in the Interpretation of Fundamental Rights

Constitutional Reform

 
The following are examples of how these themes will be explored.

 
Social Policy, Resources, and the Courts – The Distributive/Commutative Justice Distinction

This session will critically assess the distinction between the roles of judges in the context of distributive and commutative justice drawn by the Irish courts in decisions such as O’Reilly v Limerick Corporation and Sinnott v Minister for Education. It will do so by exploring a reverse version of the usual question (namely when the courts will require redistribution of resources to vindicate fundamental rights) asking instead when, if ever, courts will intervene to prevent legislatively mandated redistribution of resources. To that end, the session will focus on the decision of the Irish Supreme Court in Re Article 26 and the Employment Equality Bill 1998. We will consider what, if anything, that decision tells us about the judiciary’s self-perception of its role in reviewing social policy that has resource implications, and what that in turn might tell us about the consistency of the courts’ approach to socio-economic rights claims. These issues are particularly acute in the current political context, given the controversies surrounding austerity and social justice.

 
The Relationship Between Administrative Governance and the Courts

Increasingly, individual rights are affected by administrative decision-making as much, if not more than, legislative decision-making. Much of the substance of rights-definition and rights-enforcement takes place not in the Superior Courts, but rather in the often unnoticed and underexplored administrative sphere. Consequently, the relationship between the courts and administrative bodies, and the level of control that the courts exert over administrative decision-making, has significant implications for the level of protection of individual rights in modern society. This session will explore the current state of play in that relationship in the Irish context, using as its starting point the decision of the Supreme Court in Meadows v Minister for Justice. It will look at whether or not Irish Constitutional and Administrative law has unduly prioritised process protections, and abdicated any responsibility for the defence of substantive entitlements.

 
The Role of Interest Groups, Economic Crisis, and Legislative Freedom

This session considers two related themes in the context of the Supreme Court decision in Re Article 26 and the Health (Amendment) (No 2) Bill 2004: first, the role and position of minority interest groups in the legislative process, and in judicial review; and second, the influence, if any, that economic circumstances and implications should have on constitutional adjudication. Judges have potentially two roles in relation to the role of interest groups in politics, and in constitutional litigation: first; through their decisions they can advertently or inadvertently affect the relative power of interest groups and second; they themselves may bring to the judicial process interests that colour their decision-making. They do so against the backdrop of evolving adverse economic conditions, which bring with them increased interest group activism and heightened complexity in judicial review of legislation with financial implications for interest groups. This session will consider these themes in the context of the legal manifestation of various aspects of Ireland’s austerity programme.

 
Constitutional Reform

Constitutional reform is a live issue in Irish society, and raises a variety of questions for constitutional law. The role of constitutional lawyers in political constitutional reforms is contested and difficult, in particular in drawing the line between expertise-based contributions and political contributions to reform discourse. The practical mechanisms for constitutional reform are also a topic of contemporary debate, with the introduction of popular structures such as The Constitutional Convention; increasingly high profile Oireachtas committee hearings on constitutional issues; and debates around the merits of popular initiative for constitutional amendments. In addition, there appears to be renewed judicial willingness to engage in oversight of the referendum process in the wake of the McCrystal case, which raises questions concerning the proper scope of judicial intervention in democratic decision-making.

Describe and summarize the primary materials on competition law published by the EU, of which the module manual is composed, such as Treaty Articles, Regulations, Directives and official Notices;

Analyse, breakdown, and interpret those primary materials;

Create and illustrate independent authoritative argument and exposition on the basis of those materials and break any hold of assumptions of secondary literature and narrative.
Module Learning Aims:
A, Purpose. To teach (i) European competition law (ii) familiarity with primary legal materials (iii) analytical lawyering ability. The module innovates in basing itself on primary materials published by the EU, of which an online manual is composed, such as Treaty Articles, Regulations and Directives, and extending to official Notices and Vade Mecum. It eschews heavy reliance on academic commentary and case law analysis, with some exceptions for illustrative purposes. The purpose of the module is threefold. First, acquaintance with the subject matter. Second, skills training in the reading and analysis of primary materials, such as Regulation 1/2003 Third, the development of independent critical and scholarly argument and exposition based on the primary materials. Students should be aware that this module does not follow textbooks but looks directly to primary instruments and moves from instrument to instrument, rather than primarily thematically.
Module Content:
Substantive EU competition law. Articles 101-106 (TFEU). Areas not covered are Mergers, State Aids, and great detail about procedures before the European Commission. Many primary documents are covered. The focus is on these. There is relatively little focus on the case law of the Court of Justice or on secondary literature. By this means, the course may be taken by those with experience of EU competition law, and those with none. Students from outside Europe with no acquaintance of the EU institutional and treaty framework may take the course without notable disadvantage, provided they do some primer reading in the first two weeks.

LA7028,Ll.M Corporate Governance In The Eu,Blanaid Clarke,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

engage in high-level analysis of a range of corporate governance issues;

 express an informed view on the ultimate interests that corporate governance regulations should seek to advance;

assess different regulatory mechanisms;

identify and discuss the main themes, perspectives and issues in the area of corporate governance;

Module Learning Aims:
This module seeks to introduce students to corporate governance theories, regulations and reform proposals and to allow students to evaluate current academic research in light of current practice and challenges. The focus of the module will be on EU corporate governance but reference will also be made to the applicable regulations in the United States and other major industrialized countries.
Module Content:
The term “corporate governance” refers to the “procedures and processes according to which an organisation is directed and controlled”. This module will examine the regulatory and market structures in the EU which specify the distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in the organisation – such as the board, management, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders – and which lay down the rules and procedures for decision-making. Corporate law theory, financial theory and behavioural economics theory will be used to develop an understanding of the rationale for these structures and rules and, in some cases, their failure to meet their desired objectives. These theories will also be contextualized and current controversial topics such as board culture, board pay, board diversity, corporate ethics, corporate social responsibility and corporate governance in banks will be explored. The module will distinguish between “shareholder-oriented, Anglo-American governance regimes” which may be said to exist in the UK and Ireland and the more inclusive more stakeholder-oriented regimes which exist in Germany and other continental European countries. The impact of the Global Financial Crisis and Brexit will also be considered as will the role of corporate law in the social market economy. Reference will be made to both hard law and soft law in the corporate governance field with an emphasis on EU regulation. Throughout the module, consideration will be given to two core questions: What are the desired aims of corporate governance? What are the most efficient and appropriate forms of regulation to achieve these aims?

A maximum of 25 students is permitted on this module and places are assigned in order of registration

LA7034,Ll.M Globalisation And The Law,W. Binchy,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to: ' Assess the effects of globalisation on traditional approaches to law at the national and international levels ' Critically analyse the impact of globalisation of the categorisation of public and private law and of the interrelationship between constitutional and administrative law, international human rights norms, civil law and criminal justice ' Locate key legislative and judicial texts ' Debate current issues relating to such matters as the impact of globalisation on cultural and religious diversity, the responsibilities of transnational corporations and controls on the Internet
Module Learning Aims:
The course is designed to provide students with a new way of looking at traditional subjects - including public and private international law, human rights law, international trade law and family law - in the light of the phenomenon of globalisation and to encourage them to examine how the law should best respond to that process. It seeks to raise questions and promote informed analysis and debate.
Module Content:
In the present era of globalisation we are witnessing the collapse of national barriers in the face of the international movement of capital, workers, commodities, ideas and communications of every kind. The ending of the Cold War, the increasing power of international corporations, the development of information technology and the expansion of air travel have had a huge impact in changing global culture and on our understanding of the law. The traditional models of nation states and international law have given way to challenges to the concept of sovereignty, the development of international human rights tribunals, such as the International Criminal Court, the extension of new international legal rights and duties to non-state actors and the development of new models of global administrative regulation.
The course on Globalisation and Law seeks to examine these developments in order to gain new insights into the nature and purpose of law. It analyses how globalisation has changed traditional approaches to public and private international law, human rights law, international trade law, freedom of expression (in relation to such matters as defamation, pornography and incitement to hatred), political dissent, terrorism and cultural and religious diversity.

Module Content:
The EU is comprised of circa 500 million consumers based in 28 different countries. Although drawn from different traditions and cultures, all of these myriad consumers are supposedly the ultimate beneficiaries of the process of market integration in the EU (insofar as that marketplace provides them with high quality goods and services at optimal prices).

A closely related issue is whether the blueprint for EU law and policy in the consumer field has been adequately designed to turn its 500 million consumers from market passengers into market drivers. With all of this in mind, the course focuses on the following subject areas:

The Evolution of EU Consumer Law and Policy;

The Concept of a ‘Consumer’;

Consumer Contract Law;

Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts;

Consumer Sales, Supply of Services and Guarantees ;

Describe the nature of advocacy and reproduce some standard techniques, and improve skill

Identify and apply techniques of memory training

Apply introductory classical training in Rhetoric and structures of argument, including identification of fallacious reasoning

Appreciate the role of experience and develop an insight into the mind of the decision maker

Write better

Have practiced examination of witnesses and the Single Point Presentation
Module Learning Aims:
The purpose of this module is to impart techniques to improve the analytic, oral, and written presentation abilities of module attendees. The motivation behind this course is that (a) substantive subject areas have grown to the extent that comprehensive information grasp is impossible, and (b) cognitive and rhetorical skills training is not the focus of dedicated development in the undergraduate law curriculum, but is rather assumed to be osmotically absorbed.

Most modules focus on the transfer and testing of knowledge of a substantive area, and many are taught in the traditional way of case-centric, narrative or historic of evolution of substantive law in reaction to developments. In contrast, this module teaches a set of advanced generic thinking skills applicable to the full range of areas of law, and also to many areas of politics and social engagement.
Module Content:
Techniques applicable across most substantive areas of law are introduced, explained, and practiced, without confinement to a specific subject or legal system. Techniques covered in previous courses include advocacy, memory technique, rhetoric and argument, the role of experience, legal writing, sometimes mind mapping, and examination of witnesses

Module Content:
In this module we consider first the sources and nature of Islamic law and then the manner in which Islamic law has become relevant as either the basis of or an influence on the national legal orders of particular jurisdictions. We then look at so called Islamic finance, focusing on the aspects of Islamic law which mean that customary western forms of financial investment cannot apply for Muslims and the accommodations that a country like Ireland might make to facilitate sharia compliant investment. For the second half of the course we look at the relationship between Islam and Human Rights both generally and especially in the context of criminal punishment, the treatment of women and blasphemous speech as well as in an assessment of how western understandings and Islamic understandings of the concept of human rights elide and differ.

LA7066,Ll.M Judicial Review And Human Rights,Alan DP,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

' Describe and analyse the role played by judicial review in the broader political context of human rights guarantees

' Explain and appraise the merits and disadvantages of the systems of judicial review in operation in various common law jurisdictions

' Evaluate the leading constitutional debates on the subject of rights-based judicial review

' Critically evaluate the practice of rights-based judicial review from the perspective of constitutional theory and institutional design

' Categorise and discuss the practical effects produced by the operation of the practice of judicial review and the practical experiences of litigants. 
Module Learning Aims:
The aim of the module is to equip students to engage in a deep evaluation of the structures and methods of human rights protection in common law systems. Students come to the module having studied constitutional law in at least one jurisdiction. As such, some prior knowledge of justiciable fundamental rights can be expected. The module's theoretical approach and the extensive use of comparative material enables students to explore in detail many of the theoretical issues which have arisen obliquely when studying constitutional law and administrative as undergraduates.
Module Content:
This course examines the role played by the courts in protecting, promoting and defining human rights in domestic legal systems. Most common law jurisdictions provide for litigable human rights through constitutions or other fundamental rights documents. In many instances these rights can be asserted against primary legislation as well as executive or administrative decisions. The judiciary are charged with the task of deciding these specialised disputes between the individual and the state. (For the purposes of this course, the term ‘judicial review’ is given its broad definition which includes challenges to legislation as well as administrative decisions).

Human rights adjudication gives rise to numerous theoretical and practical issues of law and politics, which are discussed in this course. Key issues addressed include:

·   The desirability and dangers of 'judicialisation' of human rights

·   The relationship between the courts and other branches of government in the context of human rights protection

·   The consequences of a finding that government action violates human rights

·   The role that the judiciary play in promoting a 'human rights culture'

·   Obstacles for human rights litigants

 
Throughout this course, a critical approach is taken to the appropriateness and efficacy of placing the courts process and the judiciary at the centre of human rights protection. The course draws on sources from common law jurisdictions, including Ireland, the US, the UK and Canada.

Former students of this module have been successful in obtaining positions at the international criminal tribunals, in the NGO sector and in the civil service.

 
Module Content:
Warfare is as old as humanity itself, but as long as there has been war, there have been customary practices intended to limit the effects of violence for humanitarian reasons. In the last 150 years, States have agreed to codify these practices as international law. The body of rules now known as international humanitarian law (IHL) applies only in time of armed conflict or occupation. IHL aims to define the rights and obligations of the warring parties and to protect people who are not taking part in hostilities.

This module is intended to familiarize students with the rules and principles of IHL as well as with the complex regime by which they are enforced. The module is divided across eleven teaching weeks, with two hours of lectures per week. The module begins with an introduction to IHL and to the law’s historical development. There follows an exploration of the sources of IHL and the scope of its application. The module then examines the protection that the law provides to the victims of both international and non-international armed conflicts. The focus here is on modern conflicts such as those taking place in Ukraine and Syria. The module will also address the limits established by the law on the means and methods of war which may be selected by belligerents in time of armed conflict. Students will have an opportunity to explore and discuss the implementation and enforcement of IHL by State and non-State actors, domestically and on the international stage. The module concludes with an analysis of the diverse challenges posed to IHL today, from cyber-attacks to Islamic State.

In particular, the module seeks to build a student's awareness of the need for distinctive legal and social responses to gross violations, through a broader range of mechanisms than in the case of isolated violations. Furthermore, the module is designed to identify a range of comparative transitions and encourage students to identify legal, social and political factors that influence choices in the design and implementation of transitional justice institutions.
Module Content:
Transitional justice comprises the full range of processes and mechanisms associated with a society's attempts to come to terms with a legacy of large-scale past abuses, in order to ensure accountability, serve justice and achieve reconciliation. The course examines transitional justice and the legal, moral, and political challenges facing countries in transition from armed conflict or dictatorships.
The course considers strategies including prosecutions, truth commissions, reparation programs, vetting, institutional reforms and reconciliation programs. It first examines the nature of these strategies in a historical perspective. It also addresses the theoretical claims and concepts involved in transitional justice as a body of law and social enterprise. The course explores the precise nature of the international law obligations that arise following the commission of gross violations of human rights, including the obligation on States to prosecute perpetrators and the right of victims to receive truth and reparations about such violations.

Module Content:
This module explores theoretical understandings of constitutional law, partly through a focus on issues in comparative law and methodology and partly through a focus on comparative materials. The module will appeal to students interested in constitutional law, jurisprudence and comparative law.

The introductory portion of the module see the introduction of various views and theories of comparison, to explore what we think comparative law and should do, and consider the benefits and pitfalls of comparative law in the constitutional context in particular. This will ground the substantive classes to follow.

The first substantive part of the module will explore jurisprudential and theoretical understandings of constitution making and constitutional change. It will look at how constitutions are made, and how narratives about the origins and values of constitutions shapes how those documents are viewed and used in their native legal and political system. It will explore different modes and manners of constitutional change, and different ways in which constitutional change might come about, taking a particular change in values – same sex marriage – and looking at how it came about in four different jurisdictions.

The second substantive part of the module will explore foundational questions of constitution-making: who has the authority to make a constitution? How do we connect a legal system to a particular territory and a particular people?

The third substantive part of the module will explore the current challenge posed by democratic backsliding and threats to the rule of law. We will question whether there is a global crisis in constitutional democracy and, if so, what are its causes and how can it be addressed.

The final substantive part of the module will explore the question of whether constitutional amendment should be constrained. It will explore two phenomena in comparative constitutional law – that of constitutions making certain provisions unamendable and that of courts deciding that certain amendments are unconstitutional. We shall review recent attempts in the academic literature to make sense of these phenomena. This shall relate the questions of constitutional foundations and constitutional change to the practical challenge of democratic back-sliding.

LA7100,Ll.M Contemporary Issues In International Law,Michael A,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:

•  Identify core principles of public international law and evaluate their application to a range of contemporary global problems;
•  Critically analyse the case studies explored in the module from a public international law perspective;
•  Demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the relationship between international law and politics;
•  Use relevant primary materials to engage with international law from the perspective of a researcher and a practitioner.
Module Learning Aims:
The aim of the module is to introduce students to public international law in its contemporary setting. The module does so by providing students with a solid theoretical foundation in the subject, helping students to examine the goals associated with public international alongside its practical limitations. Students will explore the subject by engaging with primary materials (treaties, UN instruments, case law) and will be asked to consider public international law from a critical perspective. The overriding objective is to connect this complex and at times abstruse subject with its everyday reality and relevance in international relations. 
Module Content:
The promise of a world public order based on international law remains elusive in the face of old and new threats to peace and prosperity. States have an international obligation to pursue the peaceful settlement of their disputes, but the extent to which many global problems can be addressed effectively by international law is an open question. This module will give students a theoretical and practical understanding of how international law addresses a range of contemporary problems, such as the use of force, responses to mass atrocity, weapons of mass destruction, and disputes over territory and resources. Students will consider how international law has evolved to deal with these problems and the dilemmas that policy-makers face when trying to balance legal, political and normative considerations. The topics will be explored through primary materials and selected academic literature, and students will give short in-class presentations. Overall, the module will provide an opportunity to explore and evaluate the fluid relationship between international law and politics in the context of real-world problems.

Module Learning Aims:
This module seeks to give students a good grounding in the basic principles of patent law. It is anticipated that with this basis, students should be well placed to develop an informed understanding of efforts to align patent law internationally through the relevant international agreements and also to develop an appreciation of the extent to which patent law remains unharmonized internationally. The module seeks to provide students armed with this knowledge with the skills to view patent law issues from an international perspective, and to advise prospective clients on best practice in multijurisdictional patent protection, enforcement and commercialization.
Module Content:
Present day business activities increasingly take place at an international level, with technology and information no longer confined to national borders. Science and technology companies in particular operate in this multinational environment and for these companies, patent rights are crucial.
With the progression of globalization, IP students and practitioners need to be aware of the variations in patent law in the key markets around the world, and also need to be prepared to respond to a variety of problems that only arise in the context of multi-jurisdictional patenting activities. This module takes a practical look at patent law in key international territories: principally in Europe (on a national and regional level), the US and in Asia. As a relevant backdrop to this landscape, the principles, treaties and institutions that attempt to regulate and harmonize patent rights at the international level are also considered. Opportunity permitting, practitioners with different expertise may be invited as guest speakers to address certain topics in detail

LA7117,Ll.M Business And Human Rights,Ms Rachel,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module, students should be able to;

·   Appreciate the legal, commercial and human impacts at the interface between business and human rights.

Understand the basis for attributing obligations to respect human rights to states, multinational corporations, and other business enterprises.

·   Critically evaluate the main international instruments and policy initiatives in the area. .

·   Discuss legal and procedural barriers to remedy for victims of business related violations of human rights.

·   Demonstrate an understanding of emerging causes of action and potential effects on businesses stemming from human rights impacts throughout their operations.

·   Identify and evaluate trends towards improving transparency and accountability via policy and regulation.. 

 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Business and Human rights is concerned with improving the accountability of business for negative impacts on human rights and the environment. Alongside states’ duties to protect human rights from harm there is growing awareness amongst stakeholders, policy makers and business leaders that rights respecting business models are needed, particularly when multinational business groups operate in zones of weak governance.

This module explores the adequacy of the existing regulatory framework and emerging trends in international soft law, domestic regulation and transnational private regulation. It considers issues with access to remedy for business related human rights violations within civil and criminal law. The class will study recent cases in the home states of parent companies concerning the alleged involvement or complicity of group related operations in modern slavery, forced land dispossession, extrajudicial killings, and environmental degradation which also affects livelihoods. Lecture themes include legal and practical barriers to remedy, corporate responsibilities to conduct human rights due diligence, parent company duty of care, and the ongoing negotiations on a legally binding international treaty on Business and Human Rights.

Within this unfolding area, the objective is to explore existing challenges and encourage students to consider how states, international institutions and business could prevent violations and improve access to remedy for victims.

LA7118,Ll.M Law And Risk,Suryapratim Roy,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

·   Have a grasp on the legal principles that guide risk regulation, such as the precautionary principle and the proportionality principle.

·   Approach legal principles from perspectives found in other disciplines. In the bargain, students would appreciate the distinction between normative questions and empirical questions.

·   Pursue a practical interest in institutional engagement with risk and/or theoretical inquiry in the relationship between law and risk. 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The word ‘risk’ is now everywhere. Whether one considers media reports, regulatory decisions or commercial transactions, there is inevitably mention of some form of risk: climate risk, credit risk, health risk, security risk, risks of migration. Such references are accompanied by actions taken by agents in different professional and governing capacities: risk assessment, risk communication, risk management, mitigation of risk. The governance of danger, however, is surely not a recent development. What, then, has changed? It is time to take a step back, explore the concept of risk and how it may be governed.
The governance of risk balances a fundamental tension between the danger of the unknown on one hand, and the ability to anticipate and control the unknown on the other. Understanding and institutionalising the anticipation and control of the unknown requires hard theoretical, political and technical choices. This module concentrates on how law shapes and responds to the prevalence of risk in private and public action. Given the array of legal tools to deal with risk, the module will cover conventional approaches such as command-and-control regulation as well as more recent approaches derived from Behavioural Law & Economics. This module will engage with some central themes of risk regulation, and allow the participants to analyse aspects of risk in their chosen areas of inquiry such as financial law, environmental law and health law.

Module Learning Aims:
The module is intended to enable students to develop an understanding of the privacy and security issues, which digital technologies raise together with other challenges that these technologies raise both for law and society. The course covers a range of topics and students will be given the opportunity to research a topic of their choosing. Students will receive guidance and feedback on their work and they should gain a deep understanding of their topic. It is hoped that some students may be able to publish their essays or use it as grounding for their future legal career or further study.
Module Content:
Our world is being altered by a wide range of new, emerging, and disruptive innovations, chiefly reliant on advances in information technology. Many of these technologies involve the collect, transmission, storage, and sale of personal and sometimes sensitive information about potentially every aspect of an individual’s life. From your smart television and Fitbit to your smartphone, your Internet browsing history, and records of electronic payments, all of these technologies can be combined to create highly detailed profiles of individuals and their families.
Data protection and the security of information are of vital importance in this context. In this module we will discuss a range of these technologies and the issue they raise under data protection law, as well as the potential security risks they pose and discuss and debate their appropriate regulation. This will include discussion of wearable devices, the Internet of Things, and so-called smart computing technologies. We will also explore the use of wrap contracts (clickwrap and browsewrap) and online privacy policies and the data protection and consumer protection issues, which these contracts raise.
This is a comparative course, given the international nature of many of these technologies and the nature of the data flow, which many of these generate. Much of the focus will be more on the potential impact of the new Data Protection Regulation globally. Time permitting we will also consider broader issues of Internet governance, and relevant consumer protection law. This module challenges you to think beyond the specific legislative enactments to the real world privacy and security implications of this range of digital technologies.

To this end the module would analyse the European Commission’s regulatory efforts in three fields (three EU media policies within the Single Digital Market):

1.   Audiovisual and Media – the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) which created single European market for audiovisual media services. The Directive is currently under review to bring it in line with the new digital realities.

2.   Media Freedom and Pluralism in the Digital Age – transparency, freedom and diversity remains in Europe's rapidly changing media landscape

3.   Media literacy – the European Commission is pursuing several actions in this field aimed at increasing the critical thinking towards the media among EU citizens, including the ability to distinguish information from propaganda, to deconstruct media communication and to interact with social media in a mindful way.

 
Guest lectures are provided by industry experts from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, media consultancy companies and others.
