Module Learning Aims:
The post-Cold War rise in ethno-nationalist conflicts around the world highlights both the necessity and the difficulty of personal, social and structural reconciliation in the aftermath of political violence and armed conflict. However, whilst the importance of post-conflict reconciliation becomes ever more apparent, so too does uncertainty and disagreement among both practitioners and scholars about what reconciliation means and how it can be achieved. Reconciliation Studies seeks to develop a fuller, more complex, and more systematic inter-disciplinary understanding of theoretical and practical approaches to reconciliation.
Module Content:
This module ‘Dynamics of Reconciliation’ explores the key challenges in transforming personal, social and structural relationships that have been damaged or destroyed by conflict. A key focus in this module is why personal, social and structural relationships need to be addressed after conflict. It draws material and examples from various places of violent conflict and post-conflict division around the world, including: Northern Ireland; Rwanda; Bosnia; Central America; and Israel/Palestine. In exploring these questions we will be mindful of how experience varies in different parts of the world, and also how social factors such as culture, class and gender impact on personal experience and political issues.

Community-based learning is designed to help you connect what you are learning through realworld experiences in reconciliation work with what you are learning in the classroom. Community-based learning will help you understand what it is like to engage in reconciliation work in a post-conflict society and build practical peacebuilding and reconciliation skills.

 
You are expected to work a minimum of 96 hours with your organisation between October 2014 and April 2015. At least 24 hours should be spent in personal study/reading to prepare for the classroom sessions.

 
You are encouraged to think of your community-based learning experiences and those of other students as ‘texts’ that can be read and shared with others. We will all engage in an on-going process of reflection about how those ‘texts’ relate to academic analyses of Northern Ireland.

Accordingly, students enrolled in this class must also take the ‘Reconciliation in Northern Ireland’ module. We also will be reading about the experiences of practitioners working in Northern Ireland and in other troubled areas of the world, and you will be expected to reflect on what they have to say and compare it to your own experiences.

You are expected to make presentations about your community-based learning experiences in weeks designated in the syllabus.

The course includes a reflective silent retreat at the Benedictine Monastery in Rostrevor, Co.Down.

Compare critically paradigmatic theological anthropologies from a range of Christian traditions

Evaluate the possibilities and limitations of ecumenical convergence, and its reception, in this subject area


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module analyses the contentious relationship in Christian tradition between understanding the mystery of God on the one hand, and the human person on the other. This relationship is pivotal to the experience of ruptured communion amongst Christians; between East and West, between the churches and communities of the Western Reformations, and more recently between North and South. Focusing on the paired theological themes, Nature and Grace, participants interrogate to what extent existing tensions may be addressed in the context of ecumenical convergence, closely focusing on the on-going reception of the paradigmatic Lutheran-Catholic Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (1999).

Illustrate key historical, political and theological elements in the construction of religious fundamentalism;

Evaluate the possibilities and limitations of engagement – especially theologically – with so-called religious fundamentalism.

                

 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
So-called ‘religious fundamentalism’ continues to receive critical attention from many sectors. Christian theology, however, seems reluctant to engage in the discourse. This module, therefore, explores religious fundamentalism from an explicitly theological perspective, and with a concern (though not an exclusive concern) for Christian expressions of fundamentalist religiosity. Challenges facing module-participants include: defining fundamentalism; methodology in fundamentalist studies; and dialogue with the fundamentalist other.

On successful completion of this module students will be able to:

Recommend persuasive solutions to key questions, such as: Do Christians and Muslims worship the same God? Why do they so often seem to talk past each other when it comes to addressing the nature of God and how God is revealed in the world?

Appraise critically the literature of Islamic theology;

Distinguish between the Muslim and Christian concepts of God;

Construct a comparative theology for a mutually fruitful dialogue of faiths.

 

 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Do Christians and Muslims worship the same God? Why do they so often seem to talk past each other when it comes to the nature of God and how God is revealed in the world? One problem encountered in Muslim-Christian dialogue on God is that Christianity has often been introduced independent from the Islamic concept of God and the Muslim perception of Jesus. At the same time, few Muslims have heard an unclouded presentation of who God is according to Christianity. This graduate module seeks a) to give an advanced introduction to Islam b) explore the vital differences in the Muslim and Christian concepts of God, and how to address them via comparative theology for a mutually fruitful dialogue of faiths.

Appraise comparatively the many ways in which Hindus and Christians visualize and theologize about the divine, and its manifestations in the world, drawing on mythic stories, images used in worship, explanations of the nature of the soul and the body in relation to the divine, and the belief in living, human embodiments of God;

Situate Hindu and Christian theological key texts not only comparatively, but also in a wider context, by attending to performative, social, visual dimensions, as well as through contemporary theological insights.


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Designed as in-depth introduction to Hinduism and to Hindu-Christian comparative theology, this module studies connecting points between religion, literature and the arts in the context of classical and modern Hindu cultures, on the one hand, and between Hindu and Christian theologies, on the other. It introduces the students to Indian religious wisdom in the Bhagavadgita, the Upanishads, devotional literature, Indian philosophy and theology.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Religion has re-emerged as a significant force in the public square bringing with it a host of challenges to the manner in which social, political and cultural issues are debated and decided. This module examines the changing role of religion in contemporary society by drawing on historical and recent debates in theology, philosophy, sociology and politics. It explores the relationship between religion and ethics in societies that are at once secular and multi-religious, and considers how political deliberation on issues of critical moral global concern can be pursued. Having analysed the key points of reference in historical and contemporary debates this module will then focus on the concept of justice as it has been understood, theorised and debated in different religious and philosophical contexts with the objective of identifying the prospect of shared values in a globalised world.

Articulate basic methods and approaches to the study of the New Testament and its historical environments.

 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Distinguishing between Judaism and Christianity in the first centuries of the CE (Common Era) is difficult enough, and yet when one recognises that there were multiple forms of both within this fluid period and later it is impossible to view Christianity and Judaism simply as competing with one another and then parting in separate directions. Indeed, the ""parting of the ways"" is a crude and over simplified perception of Judaism and Christianity. This module will introduce students to the literature of the New Testament and other developments in nascent Christianity that attest to everything from a Jewish reform movement (i.e. historical Jesus studies) through to competing expressions of Christianity in the second and third centuries that struggled to gain supremacy and each of which made different claims to orthodoxy (e.g. so-called ""Gnosticism"").

Recognize religion as a complex and interrelated cultural phenomenon.
 Identify key approaches in the development of the academic study of religion
 Recognize the multi-methodical structure of the discipline and distinguish different methodologies and perspectives.
 Characterise classical positions and their foundational concepts and relate them to their historical, social and philosophical contexts.
 Apply concepts to empirical cases.

This module introduces the Academic Study of Religion in two steps. First, it gives an overview of the history of studying religion beyond religious criticism or affirmation, and how the development of this discipline has been deeply embedded in the European history of religion and modernisation. Secondly, it is demonstrated that studying religion as a cultural phenomenon means to study how religion is interrelated with possibly all aspects of human life, and that diverse approaches are needed to understand the role of religion in different cultures.
Therefore, the course will provide an introductory understanding of “classical” approaches such as the sociology, the anthropology and the psychology of religion, and of more recent concepts such as the economy or the aesthetics of religion, as well. The essay assignment will be linked to some “fieldwork” in order to get in touch with religion as a “lived” phenomenon.

HE1116,Great Speeches,Professors M.,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Acquire insight into the diversity of forms in which religion and religions impact on public debate
* Distinguish different conceptions of the “public sphere” and “public reason”
* Contextualize the authors and speeches discussed
* Identify and assess the way in which religion is involved in public communication: as topic, as part of an argument, as object of critique, as rhetoric or as position
* Identify religion as an aspect of culture and historical developments in its variety
* Understand and critically assess the problems raised about the construction of a “public sphere”, and the regulation of religion within.
* Apply the speeches, their histories of interpretation as well as the analytical concepts to their own perception of public life
 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module investigates “Great Speeches” – famous, influential, remembered speeches that made an impact on cultural and political changes in different areas of the world – with a special focus on the many and diverse roles religion has been playing in important moments of cultural change. Over the last decades, the perception of religion has changed radically. Many expected that with modernisation religion would decline, or vanish overall, which has not been the case; public perceptions often focus on the negative potential of religions, as being at odds with democratic society and its basic freedoms, recognition and peaceful co-existence of diverse identities and traditions. The conception of what is “public” is also contested, and different understandings of the “public sphere” and of “public reason” need to be distinguished.
The goal of the module is to provide different scholarly perspectives on the diversity of how religion is mediated and has been part of public debate in many, and often unexpected ways. Through the lenses of Biblical, Islamic and Literary Studies, Theology and the Cultural Study of Religion we will analyse the speeches and their contexts, from politics and cultural life, linked to the relevance of religion as argument, as rhetoric and as value background. Names such has Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Arundhati Roy and Albert Camus, Mohammad the Prophet and Ayatollah Khomeini, Saladin at the time of the Cruzades and Friedrich Schleiermacher at the turn of the Enlightenment into Romanticism, demonstrate the scope of backgrounds we will address. Knowing about the impact of religion as a cultural force will build up a competence which is most important for the encounter within a multi-cultural globalized world.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
In the region of Judea during the Greek and Roman periods there was great discontent with religious leaders and institutions, corrupt politics, disparity between rich and poor, and strife and hardships were part of daily life. Among reactions to this situation were two popular teachers: a priest now known only by his nickname, “the Teacher of Righteousness,” and Jesus of Nazareth. The Dead Sea Scrolls preserve literature that reflects the religious and theological world of the Teacher of Righteousness, as the New Testament expresses that of Jesus and his followers. These two figures serve as a point of departure for considering ancient Jewish thought and practice. Indeed, although these two figures and their groups never met, their religious thought worlds, patterns of thinking, and fierce unhappiness with the status quo offer a fruitful point for analysis. The aim of this course is to introduce students to the significance of the Dead Sea Scrolls for the study of the New Testament.

LY1100,The Making Of Catholic Theology: The Modern Period (C.1900-2000),Cornelius J,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

Describe what is meant by a living tradition with reference to formation and re-formation of Catholic theology in this period.

Explain the importance of the study of historical context for the study of theology.

Identify the theological developments and movements of renewal which preceded and prepared for the work of the Second Vatican Council

Outline key themes in the work of one influential theologian of this period.


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The purpose of this module is to survey the political, cultural and religious context in which, through a series of movements of thought, Catholic theology changed and developed profoundly in the period 1900 – 2000. The students will be introduced to the work of some representative theologians of the period. The module includes a seminar-study of the work of one such theologian. This seminar will comprise one third of the contact hours.
Among factors influencing the formation and re-formation of theology in the period are the political and social effects of the First World War, the rise of fascism and Soviet communism, the Second World War and the Cold War, the anti-modernist regime that was in the ascendant in Church circle at the beginning of the twentieth century, the rise of neo-scholasticism, movements known as ‘resourcement’ and ‘nouvelle theologie’, the gradual surmounting of neo-scholastic theology, the opening to critical and historical Catholic hermeneutics in Biblical studies, the liturgical movements’, rethinking Judaism, and the Second Vatican Council.
Among the important or representative theologians in this period, the work of Ives Congar, Karl Rahner and John Courtney Murray will be introduced.

LY1101,Jewish Origins And The Hebrew Bible: Texts And Contexts,David Shepherd,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

Identify key figures and themes in the Hebrew Bible.

Articulate in broad terms the methods used for interpreting the Hebrew Bible.

Outline basic historical periods and how documents of the Hebrew Bible have been located on a time line.

Discuss the cultural context out of which the Israelite religion and Judaism emerged.


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The variety of terms used to designate the ‘Hebrew Bible’ (e.g. Old Testament, Hebrew Scriptures, Tanak) indicate the richness of traditions related to these writings, the various ways that they are viewed, and also their life within different communities at different times. This module will orient students to the development of a variety of documents that are, or were, included in the scriptural traditions of various Jewish and Christian communities in antiquity. Questions related to forms before development of canons of scripture will be one main concern. When texts and their contents are a focal point students will be familiarised with many of the methods used for interpreting these writings. Focus on context will involve setting writings within their historical periods, political and social contexts, and provide information about material culture and archaeology relevant to a historical and literary approach to the subject.

LY1102,Catholic Theology In A Secular Age: A Critical Introduction,Cornelius J,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

Explain the role of ecclesial roots in the doing of Catholic theology

Describe and discuss a variety of theological methods and their strengths and weaknesses.

Analyse the importance of the contemporary context for the doing of theology in the contemporary period.

Make efficient use of electronic and library resources for theology.


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The purpose of this module is to introduce the student to the foundational concepts of catholic theology as a living tradition with deep roots of intellectual enquiry. There will be an examination of the concept of living tradition as it is used in this context and of the roots of catholic theology in its ecclesial context. Fides quaerens intellectum (Faith seeking understanding) is a fundamental inspiration in the making and remaking of Catholic theology.

At the same time it is recognised that in a secular age, others also seek understanding in theological terms. A study is undertaken of the concept of secularity and post-secularity. There will be an examination of the argument that there is a sort of ‘buried’ theological narrative in western culture and its consequences explored.

Theological method will be introduced, including hermeneutical theory and the debates about the ‘systematicity’ of Catholic theology, which encompasses the efforts to create an intellectual and integrated synthesis. Debates about the ultimate object of theology will also be studied, that is, what, ultimately, is theology about? Is it about texts, or is it about what the texts are about – the mystery of God? To illustrate that it is precisely the later there will be a short introduction to the thought of Thomas Aquinas.

Students will be introduced to current electronic and library resources for theology and will be required to demonstrate their use in preparing their contributions to the seminars.

LY1103,Theological Anthropology A,Fainche Ryan,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

Contrast and compare different models of revelation within theology.

Explain the ecumenical importance of the document ‘Dei Verbum’.

Describe and discuss the importance of the Jewish heritage in Christian tradition.

Recognise the distinctive theological elements in the storytelling of the early Irish crosses.

Evaluate the different approaches to the theology of grace in the writings of St Paul, Augustine, Aquinas, and Luther

Compare and contrast the Christian humanism in its main outline with those of Marx, Freud and Lacan.

Give an account of the distinctive emphasis in Eastern Orthodoxy on the theology of grace
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module studies what it means to be human from the perspective of theology. The study begins within the horizon of Jewish experience as articulated especially in the early chapters of the book of Genesis and chapters in Exodus which narrate the gift of Covenant. Within these chapters the themes of the human reality as the Imago Dei as well as the theme of deep seated human alienation are studied. In this context the concept of revelation is introduced and examined. Different theological approaches to the concept of revelation – or models of revelation – are explored. The important document of the Second Vatican Council (‘Dei Verbum’) is studied. Its ecumenical importance is examined. In a way that is both new and continuous Christian thought takes up these themes of sinfulness and salvation. The broad outlines of Christian thought in this area are introduced.

Early Irish iconography, including the great High Crosses, will be studied as a distinctive treatment of these themes. In the Western tradition grace became a key concept in the articulation of the interplay of divine and human in history. This module studies its deployment through the centuries, alongside contemporary re-workings. This vocabulary has roots in the Hebrew Scriptures as these express the Jewish experience of the encounter with God. Then in some Pauline epistles the concept of grace became an important resource for early Christians who find that their lives’ significance is implicated in the significance of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.

Subsequently the vocabulary of grace is redeployed, but also re-fashioned, argued over, refined. Among many others there are breakthrough theologies of grace articulated by Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Trent. Perspectives on graced desire and graced bodiliness will be seen as foundational to Catholic thinking on sexuality, justice, and the dignity of human life. The module will also give attention to the different and distinctive vocabularies that developed in the Eastern tradition around themes of sanctification and deification. The module will explore, in summary form, other important narratives of human alienation, including Freud, Marx and Lacan. In this regard it will debate whether there are resources in theological anthropology for an understanding of human nature which have been lost in modern culture.

LY1104,Foundations For Theological Ethics,,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

Analyse the central concepts in theological ethics such as natural law and conscience.

Evaluate the perspectives of key theologians in the major debates in theological ethics.

Describe the relationship between ethics and religious belief in the context of the Catholic tradition

Recognise and evaluate the different methodological approaches operative in theological ethics


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module introduces students to the central concepts and key debates in theological ethics, with a focus on the manner in which they are developed within the Catholic tradition. The module will examine the nature of moral experience and its relation to religious faith and in this context will consider the role of the bible in theological ethics from both historical and perspectives.

The module will introduce students to key debates in theological ethics including natural law and the universality of ethics; the nature and role of conscience, moral reasoning and the role of moral principles; the role of Church teaching authority in the Catholic tradition (the magisterium) in the moral area.

The module will also introduce students to the diversity of methodological approaches in the Catholic theological ethics including the deontological, the teleological and virtue-based approaches, and will discuss the impact of feminist and post-colonial perspectives on the shape of contemporary theological ethics.

LY1105,Introduction To Philosophy,Peter Larsen,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students will be able to:

Describe what philosophy is and why it is part of theological studies;

Appreciate of the work of the Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato and Aristotle;

Identify and critically evaluate philosophical positions;

Reflect on their own presuppositions;

Offer a reasoned defence of some of their own basic beliefs; and

Offer an informed account of the nature and importance of the interaction between philosophy and theology.


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The module is divided into two units. The first unit is Philosophy and theology and it presents many of the reasons in favour of studying philosophy, gives a survey of how philosophy might relate to theology and provides a breakdown of the main parts of philosophy.
The second unit is Greek and medieval philosophy. It explores ancient Greek philosophy as foundational for the western philosophical tradition. The unit then examines medieval philosophy which developed Greek philosophy further. The Greeks were the founders of the western philosophical tradition and the shadow of their work falls on all subsequent philosophy and brought it into direct contact with theology. The unit deals specifically with two great philosopher-theologians of the Christian tradition, Augustine (354-430 CE) and Aquinas (1225-1274 CE).

LY1106,The Making Of Catholic Theology: The Patristic Period,Cornelius J,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

Explain the contribution of major Fathers of the Church to the development of Christian Theology and doctrine.

Access critical editions of Patristic texts, reputable translations and relevant secondary literature and commentaries in this area.

Explain the importance of the Early Church Councils in terms of their historical contexts, and the doctrinal issues at stake.

Illustrate the influence of Patristic thought with specific reference to some major theologians of recent centuries.

Illustrate the phenomenon of the development of doctrine.

Critically assess the importance of tradition in Catholic theology.


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The purpose of this module is to explore the emergence of the discipline of theology in its historical, social and cultural contexts in the early post-New Testament period. The Patristic period exerted a great influence on such important areas as the establishment of the canon of Scripture, the science of the interpretation of the biblical text, the development of liturgy, and both reflection and catechesis on the sacramental rites. The Fathers of the Church contributed greatly to the development of Christian theology in such vital areas as Christology, Pneumatology and Trinitarian theology.

The Patristic era is the period of the first seven ecumenical Councils of the Church, each associated with important authoritative teaching on doctrinal matters, often occasioned in response to the emergence of heresy and schism in the Early Church. The Early Church witnessed the search for true Christian identity in relationship to her acknowledged ancestry in Judaism, her developing relationship and dialogue with the surrounding cultures in which she found herself, and her critical appropriation of some of the best elements of the Philosophical schools. The Church of the early centuries endured many waves of bitter persecution and, correspondingly, many Fathers sought to exhort people to give courageous witness to Christ and to the faith as martyrs.

This module will explore some of the contributions of the Fathers of the Church to developments in theology. Individual Fathers will be studied for their specific contributions to doctrinal issues. The variety of genres of Patristic writings will be explored and students will be encouraged to adopt a ‘hands-on’ approach to reading selected Patristic texts throughout.

LY1107,Liturgical Theology,Fainche Ryan,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

Outline the relationship between faith, reason, and imagination as interpretation of life in different periods and authors.

Distinguish analogical, metaphorical and literal uses of language.

Recognise and evaluate different approaches to the sacramental view of the world which is central to the Catholic theological tradition.

Recognise the distinctive contribution of different schools and thinkers to liturgical understanding.

Appraise the paradigm shifts in understandings of sacrament in its liturgical expression from patristic through scholastic and neo-scholastic, to contemporary.

Explore some of the principal theological themes as they relate to baptism.

Evaluate the postmodern critique of fundamental theological assertions.


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module will introduce the student to the idea of sacrament, in the first part, as a central theological hermeneutic that underpins some of the key ways of thinking in the Catholic tradition. The idea of the ‘sacramental imagination’ will be explored from the perspective of the early Christian writers (for example, Augustine), as well from that of modern theological discourse on a sacramental worldview, especially in the writings of Odo Casel, Otto Semmelroth, Karl Rahner, Edward Schillebeeckx and Louis-Marie Chauvet. A second part of the module will move to the idea of liturgy as theologia prima, and explore some contemporary expositions of (sacramental) worship as an encounter of the humanity of God in Christ (Schillebeeckx, David Power, and Chauvet). This will allow for an exposition of ritual sacramental theory through the ages: including that of Augustine, the medieval theologians and the reformation. Contemporary inter-church and ecumenical discussion will be explored. A specific sacrament, baptism, will be surveyed from the perspective of the principal debates that helped shape how it is understood today in various church traditions, and from the perspective of the various schools of thought that have been presented in the module.

Explain how the social encyclicals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries relate to the context of their composition.

Evaluate key concepts such as the common good, subsidiarity and solidarity.

Assess the contribution of Catholic social thought to specific debates on social and political issues


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module examines the modern tradition of Catholic social thought. It has a dual focus, namely, on the social encyclicals of different pontiffs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and on the diverse theological traditions of interpretation in different historical, cultural and geographical contexts. Key concepts including solidarity, subsidiarity and common good will be considered through the lens of these texts and the interpretative traditions. Theological analyses of, and responses to, specific social and political issues will be assessed. Among the issues that will be considered will be: religious liberty, economic justice, war and political conflict.

LY2301,"Prophets, Seers And Sages",David Shepherd,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

Discuss ecstatic prophetic traditions in the latter prophets within their contexts of ancient worship centres and shrines. 

Distinguish between the different layers of composition of Isaiah and suggest possible contexts against which to view pronouncements of judgment.

Articulate the unique literary characteristics of each of the latter prophets.

Engage with questions about the relationship of prophecy and apocalyptic.

Discuss the complexities of how time is used to convey meaning in prophetic and apocalyptic literature.


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
While prophetic writings found in the biblical tradition are the primary focus of this module, attention is given to several key and related areas. Questions about prophetic figures as interpreters of the present in light of access to the divine, and often times future, will play an important role in approaching the subject. The emergence of apocalypticism in Jewish antiquity and its relationship to prophetic traditions are also of interest (esp. Daniel). The latter prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Minor Prophets) will occupy the most significant amount of time, with some attention directed to works found in the Old Testament Apocrypha (e.g. 4 Ezra) and ‘Pseudepigrapha’ (e.g. 2 Baruch and ‘1 Enoch’). The role of prophetic activities within ancient social and literary contexts will be asked, however, the significance of these traditions for later religious constructions and theological expressions will also be referenced.

LY2302,The Development Of Wisdom Literature,David Shepherd,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

Discuss the complexities of defining the literary genre ‘sapiential’ or ‘wisdom.’

Distinguish crucial differences between expressions and constructions of wisdom in the Ancient Near East and in the Hellenistic Period.

Identify unique characteristics of different documents while suggesting commonalities that allow for a common grouping.

Appreciate how wisdom themes have exerted influence on writings found in the New Testament.

Situate sapiential documents within their probable historical and social context


 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module is concerned to provide a detailed synopsis of sapiential expressions found in the biblical tradition through to the transformation of wisdom in the Hellenistic period. Beginning in the Ancient Near East the book of Proverbs will be discussed in reference to Egyptian wisdom before considering the poetic expressions of the Psalms, Lamentations, and Ecclesiastes. The book of Job and questions about theodicy and the political context out of which it was written will also be addressed. Wisdom in the Hellenistic Period, particularly the Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach (Ben Sira), is given attention before turning to previously unknown sapiential works discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls that have challenged scholars to revisit perceptions of ancient ‘wisdom’ . It will also consider later Christian theology’s response to Israel’s Wisdom tradition.
