b) Literature Review

Your research project will be preceded by a review of the literature pertaining to your project.
The review should be concise and incisive, and must not exceed 5000 words, exclusive of references. Students are required to write the number of words on the front page of their literature review. Students may exceed the word limit only by 10% e.g. if the word limit is 5,000 words, a word count of 5,500 will be accepted.

It is critically important that work is correctly cited — it is plagiarism to use the work of others without proper acknowledgement. See Plagiarism (especially §54) and Instructions for Writing Reports for guidelines on citation and form of references.

The number of references quoted must not exceed 50, and preferably be many fewer. If at all possible, reviews should be used to refer to earlier work and the references should be those reporting recent work and developments more closely related to your topic. One assessment criterion is how you exercise critical judgement in choosing the reference list.

The review will become the basis of the Introduction to your Dissertation. Any recent literature which comes to your attention between January and April may of course be included. Changes in emphasis as a consequence of the realities of your research may also be made.

Please seek advice from your supervisor as to sources of historic reviews and pertinent current journal papers. Also seek your supervisor’s advice in writing the review. Each supervisor will expect to see a complete draft at some stage.

Input from the project supervisor
The project supervisor will read one complete draft of the literature review prior to submission. Do not expect your supervisor to read incomplete or multiple drafts of your work. You should provide your supervisor with a draft of your literature review one week before the submission date, in order to leave plenty of time for them to read it, and for you to take on board any suggestions that they may have for improvements.

Module Learning Aims:
This course acts to condense and focus the learning achieved in the earlier years in medical ethics, where an understanding of the ethical concepts, practice and values important for good patient care has been achieved. We now move to focus more formally on an examination of the nature and practice of professionalism and the standards required in this regard for an effective, competent and compassionate doctor.

 
Module Content:
The broad emphasis of the Professional Development course is the practical application of the standards and values required of a future professional and during the course various clinicians and specialists in active practice will discuss and explore with the students, by way of large group lecture format and smaller group workshops, the nature and role of professional behaviour in their particular medical disciplines. This allows the student to engage meaningfully with effective and experienced professional role models, with interchange and debate welcomed and promoted. In addition the role of clinical audit, clinical ethics and the critical importance of medical professional values in areas including healthcare and risk management, etc. are explored. Students will learn the importance of working effectively as team members, interacting and respecting co-workers and the importance and indeed necessity of future self-care and personal evaluation, are emphasised particularly with respect to psychological health issues, in the increasingly challenging world of healthcare.

Module Learning Aims:
The aim of Human Form and Function is to provide students with a sound understanding of the human body from the structural, cellular and organ perspectives. For convenience and because of the way in which available textbooks are named, we will be referring often to these perspectives in terms of histology, anatomy and physiology but you should remember that such a distinction is quite artificial – the body operates as a whole, structure and biological function are inherently linked and disease processes that affect any structure or activity will have consequences for the entire organism. As far as is practicable, the course teachers will try to emphasise this integration of form and function as the module progresses, since understanding this principle is essential for you to develop a good grasp of clinical practice.

Evaluate how local practice can be influenced by, and in turn influence, international practice and service delivery

Analyse the global issues common to occupational therapy practice and how occupational therapy theory forms a common underpinning of global occupational therapy practice


 
Module Learning Aims:
The overall aim of the module is to allow students the opportunity to integrate their learning from both modules completed in Semester one. This module will allow students to reflect on practice both in Singapore and in Ireland, and consider how the context of practice (culture, legislation, professional development and identity) impacts on current practice and influences future practice developments. Students will have the opportunity to observe occupational therapy practice within the Irish context and will be able to draw on similarities and differences between practices in both countries. Through facilitated clinical visits, guest lectures, and peer learning opportunities with the final year undergraduate Occupational Therapy Students at Trinity College, the students will consolidate their knowledge and debate potential future directions and developments of occupational therapy practice within the Singapore context of practice. Through active participation in all aspects of this module students will be able to consider how their new learning may influence their future practice as occupational therapists.

 
Module Content:
This module will allow the student the opportunity to observe occupational therapy practice in a foreign setting and consider how this practice approach may inform service delivery in Singapore. Students will engage in selected site visits, attend workshops and discussion forums with selected guest lecturers, and engage in peer learning sessions with the final year TCD occupational therapy students. In addition, students will be able to participate in the Inter-Professional Learning as part of this module, a case based learning approach will be used where the students will have the opportunity to learn alongside undergraduate students from Trinity College Dublin in an MDT type environment (occupational therapy, physiotherapy, medicine, speech and language therapy, and nursing students). 

 
Students are expected to actively engage during these site visits and classroom-based sessions. Emphasis will be placed on the application and integration of learning completed in semester one to actual service delivery throughout this module. Students are expected to prepare in advance for the visits and be able to engage in informed discussion and debate with the site visit facilitator on matters relating to the specific service delivery. Facilitated discussions with service users and/or representatives from relevant voluntary organisations will be incorporated where appropriate. Visits will be sourced among clinical sites where TCD occupational therapy practice education tutors are in place, but other well developed services will also be included.

 
If required, additional workshop/lectures from TCD academics will be scheduled as required depending on learning needs identified during semester one. Possible topics include disability awareness, other tutorials/workshops related to the four areas covered in the advanced practice module in semester 1, as well as other areas of occupational therapy practice in Ireland such as palliative care etc.

Debate the role of professions outside of health – architects, service planners, voluntary organizations, town planners, Ministry of Education etc., in service development and delivery.


 
Module Learning Aims:
This module takes place when students return from their overseas visit to Ireland. In this module students are expected to integrate and consolidate their learning from the previous three modules of Occupational Therapy theory, the Advanced Practice modules and their overseas visit to TCD. During their time in Ireland they will have had an opportunity to visit practice sites particularly in the areas of Primary Care, Mental Health, Older Adults and Cognitive Rehabilitation, and will have had lectures from clinical specialist occupational therapists practicing in these four areas. They will therefore be expected to use these practice-specific experiences to plan suitable occupational therapy services in these areas in Singapore through detailed service-delivery proposals. Service proposals must be based on current occupational therapy theory, reflect current and evidence-based occupational therapy practice and fit within the local context of health policy and health delivery of Singapore.

 
 
In order to evaluate the appropriateness of students’ service proposals, other health and non-health related professionals will be invited to oral presentation to critique service development plans e.g. – local gerontologists and general practitioners, Ministry of Health staff, OT managers etc.

Module Learning Aims:
The purpose of this course is for students to acquire knowledge and skills in occupational therapy practice of clients with rheumatologic and orthopaedic conditions. They will examine the occupational performance implications of rheumatological and orthopaedic conditions on self-care, productivity and leisure activities and apply this knowledge to case scenarios. Students will acquire knowledge of the range of occupational therapy interventions in all stages of an occupational therapy process from referral through to discharge. They will be expected to apply this knowledge to a range of case scenarios typically encountered in occupational therapy practice. The use of case studies in this course will provide students with opportunities to develop and articulate their different strands of clinical reasoning as employed in occupational therapy practice.

 
Students will also be expected to critique and evaluate the range of interventions offered by occupational therapists when working with clients experiencing rheumatological and orthopaedic conditions. Students will also acquire knowledge of, and will be expected to evaluate research and evidence-base practice of occupational therapy in this area of practice nationally and internationally. 

 
This course builds on previous courses such as Introduction to Occupational Therapy Theory and Processes (JF) where students were introduced to commonly used occupational therapy theories and an occupational therapy process. It also integrates knowledge from Conditions in Occupational Therapy (SF) which covers the pathology of rheumatological and orthopaedic conditions. It is expected that students will increase their understanding of this knowledge through applying it to occupational therapy practice of clients with rheumatological and orthopaedic conditions.

 
Module Content:
Course content will include:

Occupational therapy conceptual and practice models (e.g. MOHO, CMOP, PEO, Biomechanical, Rehabilitative)

Module Learning Aims:
A focus on mental health is fundamental to all healthcare delivery. Mental health problems rank second only to heart problems in terms of human cost and cost to the economy of between two% and three% of GDP. Research shows that 60% of visits to General Practitioners feature a notable mental health aspect. Mental illness is as common as asthma. One person in six will experience a mental illness. Occupational therapists need to address mental health needs not only in mental health services, but as a vital aspect of care in all settings, including, in primary care, in educational institutions, in the community and in medical and rehabilitation services. A holistic approach to care incorporates an evaluation of the individual’s mental well-being and the ability to respond with appropriate evidence based intervention.

 
 This module aims to provide students with a firm knowledge base and an orientation to the skills and attitudes necessary to provide occupational therapy to address mental health needs. This module will present a contemporary picture of practice. Current policy, law and guidelines governing care will be examined. The module will address the diagnosis, aetiology, course and treatment of psychiatric illness. Occupational therapists from a range of mental health care settings will provide tutorials and workshops.

Disability Studies perceives disability as a key aspect of the human experience and goes beyond traditional medical and therapeutic perspectives on disabilities, which habitually perceive disability as merely a characteristic that exists within the person or is a problem of the person. Instead Disability Studies challenges students to perceive disability as a construct that finds meaning within a social and cultural context and in doing so contributes to students’ professional development as client-centered and culturally competent practitioners.

 
Module Content:
 

Constructions of “normalcy”, “disability” and “disability identity”.

Models of disability (including the social model of disability, affirmation model of disability).

What have “madness” and “psychiatry” got to do with Disability Studies?

Disabling societies and disabling ideology in occupational therapy.

Disability studies perspectives and occupational therapy practice.

The emerging rights-based perspective of disability (including the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities)

Race, Culture, Social Class and Disability: Issues in Rehabilitation and service delivery.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
 

The course is designed to explore fundamental processes which regulate nervous system function. The first part of the course will revisit the importance of cytoskeletal proteins, focussing on their role in development, proliferation and growth of the nervous system and identifying the role of neurotrophins in these processes. The fact that cytoskeletal proteins play a role in plasticity will be explored.
Among the many neuronal functions which relies on the integrity of the cytoskeleton is transmitter release; the functions range from orchestrating axonal transport, maintenance of the synaptic vesicle pools, transport of synaptic vesicles to the membrane to facilitate release  and  recycling  vesicles.  These  functions  will  be  assessed  in  the  context  of understanding the complex protein:protein interactions which facilitate the many steps leading to transmitter release.
Interaction of transmitters with their receptors and the consequent triggering of intracellular cascades are central processes in communication in the nervous system. The emphasis in this part of the course will be on G-coupled and tyrosine kinase-driven receptor signalling. The fundamentals of signalling cascades will be described and specific examples given. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the particular role of kinases in modulating protein function.
The role of calcium as a ubiquitous signalling molecule will be identified. The many mechanisms which are involved in calcium transport and in controlling intracellular calcium concentration in the cell will be discussed. The effect of calcium on proteins which make up the cytoskeleton, which contribute to vesicle transport and transmitter release will be examined.

PR8001,Clinical Concepts,Coordinator Mary,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:
1. identify the responsibilities attached to the role of psychoanalytic psychotherapist, both clinically and ethically, in relation to the social, physical, sexual and psychological boundaries of the clinical setting with its need for a suitable environment;
2. describe ways of gaining access to the client's social and environmental history and their inner world to determine if they are prepared for this therapy and/or the therapy is suitable for them, being aware also of the healthy resources of the client;
3. differentiate between drive theorists and object relations theorists within psycho-analysis and the implications of these theoretical models for clinical practice;
4. describe and analyse clinical concepts, especially transference, countertransference and resistance, with a critical approach to the limits of these concepts;
5. recognise the importance of reverie to the understanding and interpretation of a dream and the patient's associations relating them to their core conflicts;
6. explain confidentiality and assessment of risk, sexual abuse, homicidal/suicidal intent, mandatory reporting and conflicts of interest.
Module Learning Aims:
The main aim of this module is to - introduce the clinical concepts used in the actual practice of psychoanalysis. These include primary and secondary identification, the Oedipus complex and its variations, Transference and Countertransference as well as the strategies of Interpretation, the Conscious and the Unconscious mind, Free association, The use of the couch in practice, Interpretation, Unconscious to unconscious communication, Projection, Projective Identification, Holding, Containing, Transference, Countertransference, Therapeutic Alliance, Therapeutic Relationship.
Module Content:
There is a great deal of psychoanalytic theory but only a small number of working concepts used in clinical work. There are a number of successful strategies which utilise these ideas such as identification, Oedipus complex and transference. This module is designed to introduce students to the basic clinical concepts of psychoanalysis. With the help of useful pre-described readings, students are encouraged to think about and discuss these important concepts in order to gain a better understanding of them. These basic concepts are then expanded by introducing the students to the theoretical divergence within psycho-analytic theory between Freud's drive theory and object relations theory, with the main focus on the British tradition of object relations theory. Starting from the seminal work of Melanie Klein, through Fairbairn's object relations theory of the personality, the imaginative and innovative ideas of Winnicott, and Guntrip's elaborations and divergences from Fairbairn, the diverse and creative ideas of the object relations school are presented, explored and discussed. Finally students explore the basic concepts of dreams and their role and importance in the psychoanalytic process.

Methods of Teaching and Student Learning:

The teaching strategy is a combination of lectures, hands-on practical lab based sessions and tutorials. The module has both theoretical and practical components. The majority of the teaching will be delivered in 3-4 hour sessions, with each session beginning with a lecture on the theoretical aspects related to localisation. This is followed by a practical session where the theory learned is put into practice on demonstration patients. This allows the student to apply and develop the theoretical concepts just learned. During the practical sessions continuous assessment and individual feedback will facilitate students getting individual attention on problem areas and also helps develop a learning partnership rather than the teacher passive learner environment.

 

 
Module Learning Aims:
This module aims to provide students with the knowledge, skills and attitude required for the practice of radiotherapy localisation and verification, recognising that these two elements are also transferable to the delivery of RT. This module covers the theory and practice of localisation, simulation and verification.

In this module different localisation techniques, field sizes and arrangements are used to demonstrate the effect beam localisation can have on the treatment plan and in clinical practice. As a result, students should be more informed as to the reasoning for different choices at the planning stage and their effect on the outcome for the patient in terms of time on the treatment unit, dose to normal tissue, potential side effects, and the effect of patient motion on the plan. Following on from this, on-treatment geometric verification will be covered so that the student has an understanding of the geometric variations that can occur while on the treatment unit and how correction strategies can be used to reduce these geometric variations.
The knowledge gained in this module will integrate with physics, PPCC, anatomy, radiographic anatomy; treatment planning and clinical practice.

 
Module Content:

Principles of localisation

The process and purpose of localisation

Using Prosoma for localisation
