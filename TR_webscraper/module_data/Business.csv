What makes it work as it does?


Could it work better in its current form?

Further as the case situations are multi-dimensional the module challenges students in real time to interpret the current case situation drawing upon key concepts their projects or other experiences from earlier in the MBA course.

 
Module Content:
Operations Strategy (OS) is defined in terms of the total pattern of decisions that shape the long-term capabilities of the operation and their contribution to overall strategy. OS achieves these outcomes through the ongoing reconciliation of market requirements and operations resources so as to achieve a sustainable fit between the two while managing the risks of misalignment. OS is different to Operations Management in terms of time scale level of analysis level of aggregation and level of abstraction.

Module Content:
This course focuses on the nature of contemporary international business. International Business combines the science and art of business management with many other disciplines such as economics sociocultural anthropology and political science. The evolution of international business as an identifiable academic discipline is as a direct consequence of the growth of multinational business and the emergence of what is widely termed the global economy. Knowledge in this global economy is rapidly transferred given technological developments in communications. The emergence of new economies particularly in Asia has transformed the centre of gravity of the global economy. International managers operate in this dynamic global environment whether in large multinational firms and their subsidiaries or SMEs/Born Globals with an international orientation. This course aims to guide the student in understanding the arena in which international business is conducted. It ranges from micro issues of staffing cross-cultural management and international strategic management to macro issues of globalisation political economic and sociocultural analysis.

Module Content:
The MBA will introduce you to leading-edge knowledge and best practice across all the functions of organisation and develop your analytical & diagnostic skills so that you will become competent at integrated strategic analyses. Our course contributes to this over-arching objective in at least two areas ; in general by setting out a broad contextual & historical perspective on the field of management and organisation and specifically through detailed examination of organisation design and its contribution to the overall capability of the business.

In fact the course is essentially about capability – the capability to organise. From at least the beginning of the 1st Industrial Revolution to the present day (and arguably for millennia before that) formal organisations have been essential in shaping and delivering strategy so that an understanding of the design principles & practical applications of different organisation design options is relevant both to business history & contemporary practice.

The course provides this contextual and historical perspective through a range of readings which are drawn from both classical and contemporary sources. We begin with an overview of the practice of management and then look at the formal organisations within which this practice takes place. Areas addressed include the nature of managerial work and the role of the general manager the contemporary relevance of bureaucracy the impact of technology and the emergence of new modes of organising – for example “Digital Taylorism” the “Gig Economy” and “Holacracy”. An integrating theme of our course will be how organisation design contributes to an organisation’s capability through the intangible capital of employees’ talent knowledge and relationships.

BU7030,Mba Company Project,FT Coordinator,"Learning Outcomes:
The central objective of the project is to assist participants in the MBA Programme to translate theory into practice. The formal content of the programme addresses itself largely to concepts theory and frameworks designed to assist in understanding organisations their environments their performance and the role and responsibilities of management. The professional practitioner has to deal with the reality of tailoring general concepts to the uniqueness of specific organisational settings. The project is designed to allow each student as an individual and as a group member to learn about the application of theory and concept to complex case studies initially and then to the substance of major strategic issues in an assigned organisation.

 The second objective is to develop holistic competencies in the conduct of diagnosis and the making of judgments. Success in the project requires an ability to gather analyze and interpret relevant data; make critical judgments and decisions; manage group processes; communicate effectively within a group with the business school faculty and with senior management in the company; and manage multiple objectives both of an academic and company related nature. These competencies which involve both technical and behavioural skills as well as an ability to manage multiple and sometimes conflicting objectives are very representative of the professional demands on general and senior managers.

 The third objective of the project is to complete the educational process of handing the learning and development process back to students and to provide them with a setting in which to take charge of their learning their standard setting and their self-assessment and performance management. At the end of the Company Project students face into the world of work with a general management qualification as distinct from the discipline based status with which they most likely commenced the MBA. The project aims to encourage and assist students to practice and display the internalized behavioural characteristics of the professional - embodied in independent and objective analysis well structured logical and insightful diagnosis practiced and wise judgment and standards of good technical and interpersonal conduct.

 A fourth objective is to assist students in making the transition from the time spent in the university fully back into professional life. The project is therefore a bridge-like experience that maintains student’s links with their professional work life. During its course all participants are actively engaged in the MBA and based in the university but simultaneously working in the unique world of the individual organisation with which they are dealing. This is true of both full time and executive MBA students.

 The fifth objective is to support in so far as is realistic the process of strategic and organisational development in the organisations in which projects are undertaken. It is important to note that the projects are not consultancy projects. They are clinical educational endeavors with which companies agree to co-operate. It is of course clear that all participating companies also have a deep interest in the content and outcome of the projects since these are chosen for their relevance to issues of major strategic significance. It is also clear that the established reputation of previous projects leads companies to have high expectations of their practical and strategic relevance.

 
Module Learning Aims:
The Company Project process aims to ground in reality the practical application of the knowledge acquired during the MBA programme. This means that although students have taken a year out to study for their MBA they remain immersed in the real world of business during that year.
Module Content:
The Company Project is the main mechanism used to integrate the individual subjects taught on the programme. It is a highly valued hallmark feature of the Trinity MBA. It involves working with blue chip corporates and dynamic Irish companies of a serious scale. These projects integrate the theoretical coursework with action learning around critical issues in live organizations. This is achieved through direct interaction with senior executives who are wrestling with strategic issues within those organizations. The process grounds in reality the practical application of the knowledge acquired during the programme. We expect that the student recommendations to the companies will be affordable highly practical and actionable. We would also expect that the companies will want to implement the recommendations.

Module Content:
The MBA will introduce you to leading-edge knowledge and best practice across all the functions of organisation and develop your analytical & diagnostic skills so that you will become competent at integrated strategic analyses. Our course contributes to this over-arching objective in at least two areas ; in general by setting out a broad contextual & historical perspective on the field of management and organisation and specifically through detailed examination of organisation design and its contribution to the overall capability of the business.

In fact the course is essentially about capability – the capability to organise. From at least the beginning of the 1st Industrial Revolution to the present day (and arguably for millennia before that) formal organisations have been essential in shaping and delivering strategy so that an understanding of the design principles & practical applications of different organisation design options is relevant both to business history & contemporary practice.

The course provides this contextual and historical perspective through a range of readings which are drawn from both classical and contemporary sources. We begin with an overview of the practice of management and then look at the formal organisations within which this practice takes place. Areas addressed include the nature of managerial work and the role of the general manager the contemporary relevance of bureaucracy the impact of technology and the emergence of new modes of organising – for example “Digital Taylorism” the “Gig Economy” and “Holacracy”. An integrating theme of our course will be how organisation design contributes to an organisation’s capability through the intangible capital of employees’ talent knowledge and relationships.

BU7090,Mba Pt Company Project,Coordinator Dermot,"Learning Outcomes:
The central objective of the project is to assist participants in the MBA Programme to translate theory into practice. The formal content of the programme addresses itself largely to concepts theory and frameworks designed to assist in understanding organisations their environments their performance and the role and responsibilities of management. The professional practitioner has to deal with the reality of tailoring general concepts to the uniqueness of specific organisational settings. The project is designed to allow each student as an individual and as a group member to learn about the application of theory and concept to complex case studies initially and then to the substance of major strategic issues in an assigned organisation.

The second objective is to develop holistic competencies in the conduct of diagnosis and the making of judgments. Success in the project requires an ability to gather analyze and interpret relevant data; make critical judgments and decisions; manage group processes; communicate effectively within a group with the business school faculty and with senior management in the company; and manage multiple objectives both of an academic and company related nature. These competencies which involve both technical and behavioural skills as well as an ability to manage multiple and sometimes conflicting objectives are very representative of the professional demands on general and senior managers.

The third objective of the project is to complete the educational process of handing the learning and development process back to students and to provide them with a setting in which to take charge of their learning their standard setting and their self-assessment and performance management. At the end of the Company Project students face into the world of work with a general management qualification as distinct from the discipline based status with which they most likely commenced the MBA. The project aims to encourage and assist students to practice and display the internalized behavioural characteristics of the professional - embodied in independent and objective analysis well structured logical and insightful diagnosis practiced and wise judgment and standards of good technical and interpersonal conduct.

A fourth objective is to assist students in making the transition from the time spent in the university fully back into professional life. The project is therefore a bridge-like experience that maintains student’s links with their professional work life. During its course all participants are actively engaged in the MBA and based in the university but simultaneously working in the unique world of the individual organisation with which they are dealing. This is true of both full time and executive MBA students.

The fifth objective is to support in so far as is realistic the process of strategic and organisational development in the organisations in which projects are undertaken. It is important to note that the projects are not consultancy projects. They are clinical educational endeavors with which companies agree to co-operate. It is of course clear that all participating companies also have a deep interest in the content and outcome of the projects since these are chosen for their relevance to issues of major strategic significance. It is also clear that the established reputation of previous projects leads companies to have high expectations of their practical and strategic relevance.
Module Learning Aims:
The Company Project process aims to ground in reality the practical application of the knowledge acquired during the MBA programme. This means that although students have taken a year out to study for their MBA they remain immersed in the real world of business during that year.
Module Content:
The Company Project is the main mechanism used to integrate the individual subjects taught on the programme. It is a highly valued hallmark feature of the Trinity MBA. It involves working with blue chip corporates and dynamic Irish companies of a serious scale. These projects integrate the theoretical coursework with action learning around critical issues in live organizations. This is achieved through direct interaction with senior executives who are wrestling with strategic issues within those organizations. The process grounds in reality the practical application of the knowledge acquired during the programme. We expect that the student recommendations to the companies will be affordable highly practical and actionable. We would also expect that the companies will want to implement the recommendations.

Marketing is primarily concerned with the task of providing consumers with a value proposition that best match their needs (current and future). To achieve this marketers must understand fully the digital context within which consumers’ decisions take place they must develop value proposition that serves both consumers (who may use those services for free) and customers (who are willing to pay for a related value proposition). They need to segment position and brand their offering in a manner that is sometimes fundamentally different than with traditional product or services. Accordingly this module unpicks the key marketing issues within the digital world and introduces participants to the useful digital tools and meaningful theoretical and strategic new model.

Module Content:
This is a case driven course. However your learning is not confined to reading the case study each week. Instead you should think of this course as having a multi-approach to learning.

Reading and Independent Learning: The book and reading (for each session/ see blackboard) provides the background theory to each of the topics we will consider. It is your responsibility to be aware of the issues in each of the assigned reading. It is your responsibility to read the book articles blogs etc.. and to extract learning. You then apply what you learn from your reading to the case study. It is essential that you come to class each week having read the assigned reading materials and prepared the case as appropriate.

Case study: Each case study has been selected to illustrate specific aspects of the weekly topic. Some of the cases are brand new and some are “classics”. The date of the case is really irrelevant; they are vehicles to illustrate firstly how the principles of marketing can be applied to its practice. Secondly they allow us to explore contemporary aspects of each topic. Finally but most significantly it is the discussion that case studies enable that is the most important this discussion should be driven by your readings your objectives in completing a Msc and the issues facing digital businesses.  

Group project: We will engage with the principles of market driven innovation in a group project. This will also encourage you to cooperate with colleagues around a marketing challenge. Both skills will contribute significantly to your ability to be an effective decision maker about marketing.

Class/group discussion: Having completed this preparatory work you come to class with opinions questions and insights which you then share in a structured way in class.

In all cases the focus will be on the valuation impact of these concepts. A managerial and behavioural focus will predominate.
Module Content:
Corporate finance concerns itself with three main issues: how corporations choose investments (real and financial) using the principles of capital budgeting how corporations choose to raise capital (in particular the choice of a mixture of debt and equity securities) and how they then choose to redistribute any surplus earned by the deployment of these capital resources (dividend decisions). At the heart of corporate finance is the concept of the cost of capital an area that despite several decades of research at least three Nobel prizes and thousands of research papers is still at one and the same time a simple concept and one that is exceedingly difficult to operationalise. The module strives to thread a line between the practical and the theoretical.
