Module Content:
The Aseptics rotation is designed to ensure that the student develops theoretical and practical experience of aseptic preparation in addition to a broad understanding of the application of aseptics and GMP, in the hospital setting. The importance of risk management and error containment in this highly skilled application of pharmacy in practice cannot be underestimated. The need for strict adherence to procedures and protocols whilst undertaking aseptic compounding is of paramount importance, reflected in comprehensive good manufacturing guidelines related to quality control and quality assurance. Appreciation of the role of the hospital pharmacist in this unique pharmaceutical field is essential. Clinical activities associated with compounds and formulations prepared under aseptic technique inherently means that students obtain a firm understanding of haematological and oncological conditions, infectious diseases and other disciplines that require the preparation of parenteral formulations of medications.
The Aseptics and Good Manufacturing Practice series of lectures will be complemented by the practical component of this rotation.
