Module Content:
Component 1: Philosophy of Religion (Dr Kenneth Pearce)

 

This component provides an introduction to philosophical reflection on religious belief and practice. We will focus on three questions:

 

What is the relationship between faith and reason? Religious believers sometimes claim that their beliefs are a matter of faith and therefore do not need to be supported by reasons. Is this claim plausible? Should rational arguments against articles of faith be taken seriously? If it’s acceptable for someone to believe by faith (without evidence) that God exists is it also acceptable for someone to believe by faith that 2+2=5?
Can belief in God be rational? Philosophers have offered a variety of arguments for and against the existence of God. We will discuss a few of the arguments that have been most influential in the Western tradition.
What is the nature of religious practice? Religions typically involve not only beliefs but also ritual practices. What is the point of these practices? Why do people engage in them? How is religious practice related to religious belief?

 

Component 2: Philosophy of Mind (Dr Ben White)

 

This component will consider some central concepts and debates in the philosophy of mind. We will focus on the mind-body problem. This problem concerns the relationship between mental states (e.g. sensations thoughts beliefs desires) and physical states (e.g. neural patterns) and how the two might interact in order to cause our behaviour. Are our minds distinct from our brains or are our sensations thoughts beliefs and desires only particular patterns of neural activity? We will consider various theories that seek to solve the mind-body problem including dualism behaviourism identity theory and functionalism. Each of these theories differs in how they conceive the nature and role of mental states. An understanding of the problem will allow us to consider related topics in the philosophy of mind such as consciousness intentionality and personal identity.

Module Learning Aims:
The modern practice of business economics and the social sciences requires at least a minimum knowledge of certain mathematical and statistical tools. In the study of statistics we ask the following question: how can we summarize data in a consistent way so as to draw conclusions from them that can be used in decision-making. Many statistical methods use a particular field of mathematics called Probability Theory which will be studied in some detail. In addition statistics uses the same form of logical rigor as mathematics.

The academic literature in fields like finance and economics in particular has become highly mathematical over the past decades. But also business people economic advisors policy makers journalists etc. even if they do not actively use mathematics and statistics (although many of them do) are confronted with analyses that use the language of mathematics and statistics. In mathematics as applied to business economics and the social sciences we mainly ask questions like: how can we model and analyse individuals' decisions? How do these change if the environment changes?

provide those with a fundamental level of economics (e.g. EC1010 or equivalent) with an understanding of the Irish economy and public policy-making; 

show how various pressures and policies have shaped the development of the Irish economy over time;

economically interpret and evaluate public policy-making in Ireland and elsewhere; and

facilitate the use of clear and concise English that is required for understanding economics and policy-making.
Module Content:
The first half of the module (Michaelmas Term) focuses on how various pressures and policies have shaped the development of the Irish economy over time. This will be achieved by connecting the forces at work that influence the Irish economy from local to global and the options available to policymakers to the outcomes of interest. Policy options include fiscal monetary/macro-prudential and trade-related policies while the “success metrics” of relevance to Irish policymakers include income population employment inequality and prices.

The issue of market provision and/or state provision provides a central and recurring theme in the second half of this module (Hilary Term). Within each policy area covered the module investigates market failure and government failure via for example consideration of externalities informational problems and an examination of the public choice perspective. Specific topics expected to be covered include: inequality; regulation (e.g. “nudging”); taxation; housing (e.g. rent control); education; health; and competition policy.

Michaelmas Term:

Objectives and Outcomes – income population and other success metrics.

Policies and Pressures – fiscal monetary and trade policies; climate technology and other forces affecting Irish development.

Ireland Until Independence – the long 17th Century; Union & the Corn Law; the Great Famine and mass migration.

Ireland Before the EU – autarky; the switch to openness and FDI; joining the EEC.

The second half of the module covers contemporary monetary economics and its application to the conduct of monetary policy. As well as reviewing the relevant academic literature the module deals with the experience of the main central banks with a particular focus on the European Central Bank. The module first analyses the nature of money and the long-run relation between money and prices and economic activity. It then examines a number of key issues in regard to contemporary monetary policy: monetary policy rules the role of expectations and the transmission mechanism. For this purpose the course presents the New Keynesian model which is now widely used for the purpose of analysing monetary policies. The course then looks at the monetary policy strategies of the major central banks as well as the operational frameworks by which they steer interest rates. The module concludes by looking at the conduct of monetary policy during the financial crisis covering issues such as non-standard measures the implications of the zero bound on nominal interest rates and the role of monetary policy in contributing to financial stability.

Having successfully completed this module you will be able to:
Analyse monetary theory in greater detail
Outline the intellectual roots of monetary and macroeconomic theory
Use monetary theory to assess how it may be implemented as monetary policy
Module Learning Aims:
The stance of monetary policy has a significant influence on financial markets which in turn may seriously impact on the real economy. The recent near meltdown in financial markets raises issues as to the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve System the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. The US and Great Britain have recently experienced the type of banking runs and financial collapses that many commentators believed could no longer occur in a developed economy. In the European Monetary Union continuous crises have been marked by capital flight and financial bankruptcies. The investment banking sector at Wall Street has undergone dramatic bankruptcies nationalizations and take-overs. In Ireland the financial system has witnessed a series of traumatic shocks since 2008 that have had enormous repercussions for the real economy. What is happening and why has there been so much intervention from governments Central Banks and the International Monetary Fund?

Financial bubbles and bank runs have occurred since the eighteenth century. Over the centuries monetary theory has analysed these types of issues. The objective of this course is to link monetary theory to monetary policy by investigating the type of theories that evolved and the way in which they were recommended as policies across time. The time period stretches from the era of mercantilism to new classical macroeconomics. By analysing the different monetary theories applied through time it is hoped to evaluate the intellectual criteria on which current monetary policy is based. Are these criteria deeply influenced by the view that money matters or the opposing view that money does not matter? Is money neutral super-neutral or does it have a real influence on the economy? In answering these questions one is better positioned to examine the type and impact of monetary policies implemented by the major central banks in the global economy.

EC4130,Economics Dissertation,Michael King,"Learning Outcomes:
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
1. In the Moderatorship examination candidates taking BESS single honours economics PPES single honours economics or TSM Pattern B (majoring in economics) may be permitted by the Department of Economics to substitute a dissertation for an economics module.The dissertation will be undertaken under the supervision of a member of the Department of Economics. Dissertations should not be undertaken lightly and are more suited to the academically strong student who has developed a keen interest in a particular facet of economics. A dissertation involves the undertaking on an analysis of an original research question which may be theoretical or applied. A dissertation is not a term paper!

2. Normally only students who have achieved at least a 11.1 in their Junior Sophister examination will be permitted to do a dissertation. Dissertation topics will normally be related to a Sophister course taken by the candidate in either the JS or SS and the supervisor might well be the person giving that course.

3. Dissertations (two copies) must be submitted for examination to the Economics Department by 5pm the Friday of Week 8 of Hilary Term. It is in the student's strong interest to maintain contact with his or her supervisor while writing the dissertation and students are recommended to agree a meetings protocol with the supervisor by the end of Week 3 Michaelmas Term. After giving initial guidance on dissertation structure data sources etc. a supervisor would normally expect to read each chapter in draft form and to return these chapters with comments to the student. The supervisor would expect to see a full final draft of the dissertation two weeks prior to the submission date. Where the supervisor is of the opinion that the draft dissertation is not of a pass standard he or she will inform the student of that opinion at this time.

4. Since the abolition of the General Paper there is no 'fall-back' option for students in the event of a dissertation project running into difficulties. You should therefore take a full complement of lecture modules until you and your supervisor pass the point at which you have a satisfactory dissertation.

5. The probability of dropping out of the dissertation stream is reduced by submitting a well thought out dissertation proposal by the end of October; by commitment to a regular schedule of consultation with the supervisor and doing regular work on the dissertation. The main reasons why people have dropped out of the dissertation stream in the past have been factors such as;

Not enough work done by Christmas;

The pressures of job search;

The feeling that a wrong decision was made to do a dissertation;

Inability to access data that had originally been promised;

Complacency and easy option expectations are wrong: Dissertations do not necessarily achieve better grades than examinations.

6. The key issue in a dissertation if to decide the question you wish to try to answer. This should be narrowly focused and manageable. The dissertation should display a thorough grasp of the theoretical principles involved and should be properly referenced and located in the literature.

7. Length should be about 8000 to 10000 words and in no case should exceed 12000 words. Dissertations should be typed and ring-bound. A major factor in dissertations being over-long is extensive literature review. Students should only include in their review literature which is directly relevant to the thesis they are examining in the dissertation.

8. The crucial dates in seeking permission to undertake a dissertation are the
following:

Submit a one page preliminary proposal to the Department of Economics by the end of Week 12 of Hilary term in your JS year

Plan a modicum of vacation work on your topic to facilitate submission of your formal dissertation proposal (2-3 pages) by the end of Week 3 of Michaelmas term. A decision will be given in the following week giving/not giving formal approval for the student to proceed.

Present a short progress report in Week 8 of Michaelmas Term. It is strongly advised that you continue to attend your fourth module until such time as this progress report is approved by supervisor/coordinator.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Overall this module examines one of the most striking features of the world: cities. Cities account for a tiny fraction of land use but over half the world's population and almost all economic activity. They are at the heart of economic growth and development: the wealthier we have become the more important cities have become. Therefore as researchers and policymakers we need to understand cities and the forces of agglomeration and clustering that sustain them.

During Michaelmas Term (Part A Urban Development & Housing Markets) students will be introduced to the main steps involved in applied economic research using the subject of urban development as reflected in the housing market. Lectures covering seminal theories relating to city growth and housing markets will set the groundwork for applied research which will focus on two major U.S. cities. Students will summarize the existing literature on the economic development of their city of focus and then gather and analyse housing market data for that city. Both these strands will be used to develop research proposals. Work during Michaelmas Term will be assessed through continuous assessment involving both individual and group work.

In Hilary Term (Part B Applied Urban Economics) we will start by exploring the theoretical foundations of agglomeration economies and empirical evidence. In other words what are the forces that cause individuals and firms to cluster at high densities? Can we distinguish between different types of forces? We will examine the role of cities in economic growth and how urbanization processes in low-income countries nowadays differ from those experienced by now industrialized countries. We will talk about how transport networks shape the spatial distribution of economic activity. We will also examine how cities affect the environment and how the environment influences urbanization. Across these topics we will investigate the role of new sources of large datasets (often referred to as “big data”) in an urban context.

Part A – Urban Development & Housing Markets (Ronan Lyons)
Students that successfully complete this module will be able to:

Discuss the key theories and empirical facts around city growth and housing markets

Summarize the principal phases and turning points in a city’s development

Outline the key forces at work in shaping a city over time

Identify research questions to develop policy lessons from past episodes of a city’s growth

Gather relevant data to answer the research question
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Overall this module examines one of the most striking features of the world: cities. Cities account for a tiny fraction of land use but over half the world's population and almost all economic activity. They are at the heart of economic growth and development: the wealthier we have become the more important cities have become. Therefore as researchers and policymakers we need to understand cities and the forces of agglomeration and clustering that sustain them.

During Michaelmas Term (Part A Urban Development & Housing Markets) students will be introduced to seminal theories relating to city size and growth and relating to housing markets. This will set the groundwork for applied research focusing on two major cities. Working individually and in groups students will summarize the existing literature on the economic development of both cities and phases and turning points in the cities’ development. Students will use this to identify research questions and gather the data required to answer these questions. There will be a reliance on continuous assessment and collaborative work during Michaelmas Term.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
In Hilary Term (Part B Applied Urban Economics) we will start by exploring the theoretical foundations of agglomeration economies and empirical evidence. In other words what are the forces that cause individuals and firms to cluster at high densities? Can we distinguish between different types of forces? We will examine the role of cities in economic growth and how urbanization processes in low-income countries nowadays differ from those experienced by now industrialized countries. We will talk about how transport networks shape the spatial distribution of economic activity. We will also examine how cities affect the environment and how the environment influences urbanization.

The purpose of this module is to build on the understanding of the economic theory of government intervention developed in Year 1 and to progress to understanding how such government intervention can be delivered effectively. The starting point is standard public/welfare economics with government seen as intervening in a number of different ways to improve on the market outcome or address market failures. The course continues by considering the various techniques for programme and project evaluation and then reviews a series of case studies involving the use of these methodologies in Irish and international contexts. Applications will cover areas such as health care labour markets infrastructure road safety environmental policy and agricultural and food. These will provide a more policy-focussed understanding of the key welfare economics and evaluation material and most importantly suggest possible dissertation topics. The course will build on EC8006 illustrating the application of statistical techniques to project evaluation.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This is a problem'based course comprising the following components:

1st Semester / Michaelmas Term;

Component 1- Philosophy of Religion (Prof. O’Grady)

This course offers an introduction to some of the main topics in philosophy of religion. It analyses how philosophical approaches to religion differ from other kinds of approach. Then two traditional arguments for God’s existence are explored in some detail. The cosmological argument is one which seeks to argue from certain phenomena in the world to the existence of a non-spatio-temporal cause of these. The general features of such arguments are explored as well as standard objections to them. Then a classical and a modern version of this argument are examined. The argument to design is another traditional argument for God’s existence. A famous version of this from William Paley is examined along with important objections to it from evolutionary theory and from the great Scottish philosopher David Hume. Then a modern version of this argument developed by Richard Swinburne is assessed. Finally the problem of evil is examined. This is the supposed incompatibility of the existence of an all good and all powerful God with the existence of evil. Different versions of the argument are explored and the free will defence in the version devised by Alvin Plantinga is assessed.

Component 2 – Moral Philosophy (Paal Antonsen)

It is impossible to go about our lives without deliberating about what we should do and how we should live. In this course we will look at a series of practical ethical dilemmas we all face in our everyday lives: What should we give to the poor? Can we justify spending a lot more on friends family and ourselves than on strangers in need? What should we be able to buy sell and trade? Are there some things that cannot or should not be assigned a market value and if so why? Is it always wrong to end a life? What about cases of abortion or non-human animals? Are we justified in eating animals or should we be vegetarians? What obligations should we accept in the face of climate change?

In addition to such practical questions we can take one step further and also reflect on the grounds for making our decisions. What makes an action right or wrong at all? What are the relationships between morality and science and morality and religion? And why be moral at all? In pursuing these questions we will distinguish consequential and categorical premises in moral arguments. These two types of premises play the central role in two dominant ethical traditions: utilitarianism and deontology. We will look at central texts from these traditions dealing both with practical and theoretical questions of ethics.

2nd Semester / Hilary Term; Component

Component 3 – Philosophy of Mind (Dr. Connolly)

This course will consider the nature of mental states like thoughts beliefs perceptual experiences… and what the relation might be between mental states and physical states. In other words how do minds fit into the physical world? The views on this question that will be examined include dualism according to which mental states are states of non-physical minds/souls behaviourism according to which talk of beliefs and so on is just talk of how people are disposed to behave The mind-brain identity theory according to which a type of mental state is just a type of physical state and functionalism which treats the relation between mental states and physical states as similar to the relation between computer hardware and software. The so-called ‘mind-body problem’ will be the main preoccupation of the course but other questions that will be covered include: what is consciousness; can computers think; is it possible to survive death by uploading your mind to a computer?

Component 4 – Metaphysics (Prof. Simons)

Metaphysics as the most general philosophical science of what there is tends to deal in disputed entities. The oldest and most continuously case of disputed entities is universals. These are properties and relations which repeat or recur in many things without themselves being multiplied. Examples are the colour green found in many green things; humanity present in all humans; and being heavier than holding between many pairs of bodies. We will look at the principal arguments for and against the existence of universals. There are several enduring benefits of looking at the problem apart from its intrinsic interest and importance: it provides the pradigmatic example of a metaphysical disputes pro and con a given class of entity; it furnishes a characteristic framework and an all-purpose vocabulary for such disputes; and it illustrates the special nature of philosophical argument.

This is a historically'based course running for two years. In the first year there are the following components:

1st Semester / Michaelmas Term

Component 1- Ancient Philosophy (Prof. Politis)

Ancient philosophy provided it is treated of thematically and not purely historically provides an excellent focus for some major philosophical themes. (1) We begin with Parmenides’ claim that the notion of change is incoherent from which he derived that the appearance of change is mere appearance or even illusion. (2) We take up Aristotle’s response to this challenge which provided him with an opportunity to develop an account of the metaphysics of changing particulars (we shall also compare his account to Plato’s). (3) We turn to the Socratic conception of philosophical argument and inquiry based on the search for the knowledge of essences as a means of answering certain central aporiai. (4) We follow the trials and tribulations of the notion of essence from Plato’s theory of forms to Aristotle’s hulomorphism. (5) We conclude with some skeptical notes on this whole project of essence-based metaphysics as articulated by some15 ancient skeptics and summarized in Sextus Empiricus.

Component 2 – Medieval Philosophy (Prof. O’Grady)

The time scale of medieval philosophy is very long from Augustine (354-430) to William of Ockham (d.1347). The philosophers of this period built on and developed ancient philosophy especially the thought of Plato and Aristotle mediated though later Greek schools such as Neoplatonism. Many of the major philosophers of the period were concerned with relating philosophy to the Abrahamic religious traditions of Judaism Christianity and Islam. Given the diversity of strands and figures in this period the course will begin and end with a survey of main figures and historical movements but will focus on two key figures of the period. We will begin with Augustine examining how he brought Greek philosophy into dialogue with Christianity and looking specifically at his rejection of skepticism and his positive account of knowledge. Then we will move on to Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) and explore his general metaphysical system as well as his account of mind. Hence this course will examine an influential epistemological position an influential metaphysical position and an influential account of mind from the medieval period.

2nd Semester / Hilary Term

Component 3 – The Rationalists (Prof. Levine)

This component focuses on the epistemology and metaphysics of Descartes Spinoza and Leibniz primarily through examining some of their central works—Descartes’ Meditations Spinoza’s Ethics and Leibniz’s Discourse on Metaphysics.

Component 4 – The Empiricists (Dr. Storrie)

With the publication of Newton’s Principia (1687) Britain and Ireland became the centre of the intellectual world for three generations. This module focuses on the development of British Empiricism through the works of John Locke (1632 - 1704) George Berkeley (1685 - 1753) and David Hume (1711 - 1776).

Locke held that all ideas are ultimately derived from experience and that our knowledge extends no further than those ideas. In addition Locke contributed to our understanding of difficult metaphysical issues including (i) free will (ii) the nature of substance and (iii) personal identity.

Berkeley claiming that Locke’s (and the rationalists’) metaphysics leads to an unacceptable skepticism about the existence and nature of sensible things attempted to prove that there is no such thing as material substance and that the only things that exist are minds (including God) and ideas.

Hume advocated a scientific attitude to understanding the human mind which led him to new and surprising doctrines concerning (i) - (iii) and to a form of skepticism that Berkeley would have found repugnant.

Component 1- Philosophy of Language (Dr. James Miller)

Words in all languages including those that are non-verbal have meaning. Without this property we would not be able to communicate with each other. But what is meaning and how is it that words come to mean what they do? This course will consider these questions by examining a number of theories of meaning. These theories consider whether meaning is based on certain mental states or concepts internal to us that are attached to words; whether meaning is inherently social and shared and whether the existence of meaning presupposes that we are part of a community that mean the same thing by the same words; or whether meaning is secured by what object words refer to in the external world. In this component we will consider each of these and various hybrid theories of meaning whilst noting the consequences that these theories have for other areas of philosophy especially for the philosophy of mind metaphysics and epistemology.

Component 3 - Introduction to Political Philosophy (Dr. Ben Bramble)




Governments make laws and punish people for breaking them. But what exactly is punishment? We will begin this module by seeing if we can come up with a clear definition of punishment (something that is itself surprisingly difficult). Having done this we will turn to the question of whether punishment by the state can ever be justified. We will look first at consequentialist theories on which the justification of punishment lies in its having good consequences. We will then examine several sophisticated retributivist justifications of punishment. Next we will consider two leading abolitionist theories on which punishment is never justified. Finally we will look at several alternatives to punishment including victim restitution and restorative justice.

Component 1- Ethics (Dr. Ben Bramble)


Lives can go well or poorly for their subjects. What makes this so? In this module we will examine the main answers philosophers have given to this question. We will begin by looking at subjectivist theories on which an individual's well-being is determined just by that individual's desires or attitudes. We will then turn to objectivist theories on which well-being is determined not just by one's own desires or attitudes. Among the theories we will consider in the module are hedonism desire-satisfactionism idealised life preferentism perfectionism and list theories.

Component 2 – God and Freedom (Dr. Kenneth Pearce)

The major Abrahamic religions have traditionally held that God is perfectly good and perfectly wise or rational and at the same time that God is perfectly free. In particular it has seemed important to many philosophers and theologians working within these traditions that God be free to create a different world or no world at all. This gives rise to a puzzle. On the one hand it seems that a perfectly good and perfectly wise being must necessarily choose what is best. On the other hand it seems that a being who must necessarily choose the best is not free. In Can God Be Free? William Rowe argues that none of the proposed solutions to this problem is successful. The traditional conception of God Rowe concludes is incoherent and must be rejected. In addition to these problems about God's freedom many philosophers have thought that the existence of an omnipotent and omniscient creator would threaten our freedom. This component will examine these problems about God and Freedom along with various proposed theistic responses.

Component 4 – Epistemology



 
The course begins with a brief survey of the major movements in Indian and Chinese thought before focusing on Buddhist philosophy as the core topic of this course. The Indian background to Buddhism is explored characterizing what Buddhist thought was rejecting and exploring the life of the Buddha as a fundamental aspect of Buddhism. Core teachings of Buddhism such as the four noble truths and the noble eightfold path are explored alongside the ethical and metaphysical implications of such teachings. We examine the growth of different schools of Buddhist philosophy and concentrate on the Madhyamika school and the foremost philosopher of this school Nagarjuna. We examine his classic work the Mulamadhyamikakarika and explore its relationship to skepticism and antirealism while acknowledging its religious intent.

Component 1: Philosophy of Religion (Dr Kenneth Pearce)

This component provides an introduction to philosophical reflection on religious belief and practice. We will focus on three questions:

What is the relationship between faith and reason? Religious believers sometimes claim that their beliefs are a matter of faith and therefore do not need to be supported by reasons. Is this claim plausible? Should rational arguments against articles of faith be taken seriously? If it’s acceptable for someone to believe by faith (without evidence) that God exists is it also acceptable for someone to believe by faith that 2+2=5?
Can belief in God be rational? Philosophers have offered a variety of arguments for and against the existence of God. We will discuss a few of the arguments that have been most influential in the Western tradition.
What is the nature of religious practice? Religions typically involve not only beliefs but also ritual practices. What is the point of these practices? Why do people engage in them? How is religious practice related to religious belief?

Component 2: Philosophy of Mind (Dr Ben White)

This component will consider some central concepts and debates in the philosophy of mind. We will focus on the mind-body problem. This problem concerns the relationship between mental states (e.g. sensations thoughts beliefs desires) and physical states (e.g. neural patterns) and how the two might interact in order to cause our behaviour. Are our minds distinct from our brains or are our sensations thoughts beliefs and desires only particular patterns of neural activity? We will consider various theories that seek to solve the mind-body problem including dualism behaviourism identity theory and functionalism. Each of these theories differs in how they conceive the nature and role of mental states. An understanding of the problem will allow us to consider related topics in the philosophy of mind such as consciousness intentionality and personal identity.

 
2nd Semester / Hilary Term; 

Component 3: Introduction to Moral Philosophy (Dr Lizzy Ventham)

Moral philosophers aim to understand (among other things) which actions are the right actions and what a good world would look like. This module will provide a solid foundation in ethical theory by examining three of the most important approaches to normative ethics: consequentialism deontology and virtue ethics. Students will learn to critically evaluate arguments for and against different theories. Using that foundation students will go on to apply what they’ve learned to some modern problems in practical ethics.

Component 4: Poilitical Philosophy (Dr Brian Carey)

The state claims that it has a moral right to command and to be obeyed. To enforce these claims the state is able to coerce people in all sorts of ways from fines to imprisonment or worse. But are these claims and powers justified and if so what philosophical theory best explains why we ought to do what the state says?

In this module we will examine what has become known as ‘the problem of political obligation’. We will consider from a philosophical perspective what features a state would need to have in order for it to count as a ‘legitimate’ authority. We will consider the strengths and weaknesses of a number of views ranging from those which hold that all states are illegitimate to those that suggest all of us have a moral obligation to create sustain and obey the authority of the state.

Component 3: 17th Century Philosophy (Dr Kenneth Pearce)

 
The rise of mechanism – the picture of the material universe as a 'grand machine' whose motions can be explained geometrically – in the early 17th century required new approaches to a variety of philosophical problems including free will the nature of the human person the existence and nature of God sensory perception knowledge and causation. One philosophical school known as 'Cartesianism' after its founder Rene Descartes sought to answer these questions by defending a radical distinction between mind and body. By sharply separating mind and matter (relatively) traditional views about the human mind and about God could be combined with a staunchly mechanistic view of the material world.

Cartesianism was the dominant philosophical school in Europe in the second half of the 17th century. However it was not without its critics. This component will examine the philosophy of Descartes and two of his 17th century critics Margaret Cavendish and John Locke. Cavendish’s criticisms are primarily metaphysical and scientific: she takes issue with Descartes’s account of the nature of matter. Although Locke also rejects Descartes’s theory of matter his criticisms are primarily epistemological: he takes issue with Descartes’s account of how the human mind comes to know the material world.

Component 4: 18th Century Philosophy (Mr Peter West)

The writings of Descartes and Locke in the seventeenth century were hugely influential on philosophers up until the end of the eighteenth century. As a result many of the issues discussed by thinkers in the eighteenth century were very similar to those covered in component 1 (17th C). What is the relationship between the mind and the world? How do we gain knowledge of things that exist outside the mind? How do we gain knowledge of God and what he is like? This component will focus on three thinkers who tackle such issues: George Berkeley David Hume and Thomas Reid.

      Berkeley presents a set of arguments against the view that the world is made up of ‘matter’ and that the ‘material objects’ that it is filled with cause us to experience the world in certain ways. Berkeley argues that matter does not exist; instead Berkeley believes that only minds and ideas exist. Berkeley believed that his arguments against matter would save common sense and avoid scepticism. We will examine the reasons why Berkeley made this perhaps surprising claim and find a way to understand why he believed only minds and ideas exist.

      Hume agreed with many of Berkeley’s claims and was particularly worried by how many philosophers understood causation in the world around us. However Hume’s concerns lead him to be a sceptic: to argue that human reason is incapable of answering many questions about the world around us. By the end of the eighteenth century Reid found that most of the philosophy that had preceded him (from Descartes through Locke Berkeley and Hume) was based on a mistaken assumption: that we gain knowledge about the world around us by means of ideas which exist in our minds and represent the way the world is to us. Reid argued that if we follow common sense we will realise that these ideas do not exist. In response Reid offers an alternative more direct account of our knowledge of the world around us.

What is the general structure of an aporia?

What are examples of such aporiai from Plato or from Aristotle or from your experience?

Why are aporiai so important for philosophical enquiry?

What is the relation between thinking that philosophical enquiry is rooted in aporiai and being a sceptic about philosophical enquiry?

Is there any general reason for thinking that no philosophical aporiai can be answered by us?

TOPIC 3. HUMAN DESIRE AND ITS OBJECTS

Is there an important distinction between doing what one desires and doing what seems best to one?

Do we desire what really is good or only what appears good to us?

Can I be seriously mistaken about what is good for me?

Can I be seriously mistaken about what I desire?

Is there a single ultimate object of human desire?

Is this object happiness?

Component 1: Philosophy of Religion (Dr Kenneth Pearce)

This component provides an introduction to philosophical reflection on religious belief and practice. We will focus on three questions:

What is the relationship between faith and reason? Religious believers sometimes claim that their beliefs are a matter of faith and therefore do not need to be supported by reasons. Is this claim plausible? Should rational arguments against articles of faith be taken seriously? If it’s acceptable for someone to believe by faith (without evidence) that God exists is it also acceptable for someone to believe by faith that 2+2=5?
Can belief in God be rational? Philosophers have offered a variety of arguments for and against the existence of God. We will discuss a few of the arguments that have been most influential in the Western tradition.
What is the nature of religious practice? Religions typically involve not only beliefs but also ritual practices. What is the point of these practices? Why do people engage in them? How is religious practice related to religious belief?

Component 2: Philosophy of Mind (Dr Ben White)


This component will consider some central concepts and debates in the philosophy of mind. We will focus on the mind-body problem. This problem concerns the relationship between mental states (e.g. sensations thoughts beliefs desires) and physical states (e.g. neural patterns) and how the two might interact in order to cause our behaviour. Are our minds distinct from our brains or are our sensations thoughts beliefs and desires only particular patterns of neural activity? We will consider various theories that seek to solve the mind-body problem including dualism behaviourism identity theory and functionalism. Each of these theories differs in how they conceive the nature and role of mental states. An understanding of the problem will allow us to consider related topics in the philosophy of mind such as consciousness intentionality and personal identity.

Component 1: Introduction to Moral Philosophy (Dr Lizzy Ventham)

Moral philosophers aim to understand (among other things) which actions are the right actions and what a good world would look like. This module will provide a solid foundation in ethical theory by examining three of the most important approaches to normative ethics: consequentialism deontology and virtue ethics. Students will learn to critically evaluate arguments for and against different theories. Using that foundation students will go on to apply what they’ve learned to some modern problems in practical ethics.

Component 2: Poilitical Philosophy (Dr Brian Carey)

The state claims that it has a moral right to command and to be obeyed. To enforce these claims the state is able to coerce people in all sorts of ways from fines to imprisonment or worse. But are these claims and powers justified and if so what philosophical theory best explains why we ought to do what the state says?

In this module we will examine what has become known as ‘the problem of political obligation’. We will consider from a philosophical perspective what features a state would need to have in order for it to count as a ‘legitimate’ authority. We will consider the strengths and weaknesses of a number of views ranging from those which hold that all states are illegitimate to those that suggest all of us have a moral obligation to create sustain and obey the authority of the state.

The ‘What is it?’ question

The idea of aporia (puzzlement philosophical puzzles and problems)

Human desire and its objects.


Component 2: Medieval Philosophy (Prof. Paul O'Grady)

The time scale of medieval philosophy is very long from Augustine (354-430) to William of Ockham (d.1347). The philosophers of this period built on and developed ancient philosophy especially the thought of Plato and Aristotle mediated though later Greek schools such as Neoplatonism. Many of the major philosophers of the period were concerned with relating philosophy to the Abrahamic religious traditions of Judaism Christianity and Islam. Given the diversity of strands and figures in this period the course will begin and end with a survey of main figures and historical movements but will focus on two key figures of the period. We will begin with Augustine examining how he brought Greek philosophy into dialogue with Christianity and looking specifically at his rejection of skepticism and his positive account of knowledge. Then we will move on to Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) and explore his general metaphysical system as well as his account of mind. Hence this course will examine an influential epistemological position an influential metaphysical position and an influential account of mind from the medieval period.

Component 1: 17th Century Philosophy (Dr Kenneth Pearce)

The rise of mechanism – the picture of the material universe as a 'grand machine' whose motions can be explained geometrically – in the early 17th century required new approaches to a variety of philosophical problems including free will the nature of the human person the existence and nature of God sensory perception knowledge and causation. One philosophical school known as 'Cartesianism' after its founder Rene Descartes sought to answer these questions by defending a radical distinction between mind and body. By sharply separating mind and matter (relatively) traditional views about the human mind and about God could be combined with a staunchly mechanistic view of the material world.

Cartesianism was the dominant philosophical school in Europe in the second half of the 17th century. However it was not without its critics. This component will examine the philosophy of Descartes and two of his 17th century critics Margaret Cavendish and John Locke. Cavendish’s criticisms are primarily metaphysical and scientific: she takes issue with Descartes’s account of the nature of matter. Although Locke also rejects Descartes’s theory of matter his criticisms are primarily epistemological: he takes issue with Descartes’s account of how the human mind comes to know the material world.

Component 2: 18th Century Philosophy (Mr Peter West)

The writings of Descartes and Locke in the seventeenth century were hugely influential on philosophers up until the end of the eighteenth century. As a result many of the issues discussed by thinkers in the eighteenth century were very similar to those covered in component 1 (17th C). What is the relationship between the mind and the world? How do we gain knowledge of things that exist outside the mind? How do we gain knowledge of God and what he is like? This component will focus on three thinkers who tackle such issues: George Berkeley David Hume and Thomas Reid.

      Berkeley presents a set of arguments against the view that the world is made up of ‘matter’ and that the ‘material objects’ that it is filled with cause us to experience the world in certain ways. Berkeley argues that matter does not exist; instead Berkeley believes that only minds and ideas exist. Berkeley believed that his arguments against matter would save common sense and avoid scepticism. We will examine the reasons why Berkeley made this perhaps surprising claim and find a way to understand why he believed only minds and ideas exist.

      Hume agreed with many of Berkeley’s claims and was particularly worried by how many philosophers understood causation in the world around us. However Hume’s concerns lead him to be a sceptic: to argue that human reason is incapable of answering many questions about the world around us. By the end of the eighteenth century Reid found that most of the philosophy that had preceded him (from Descartes through Locke Berkeley and Hume) was based on a mistaken assumption: that we gain knowledge about the world around us by means of ideas which exist in our minds and represent the way the world is to us. Reid argued that if we follow common sense we will realise that these ideas do not exist. In response Reid offers an alternative more direct account of our knowledge of the world around us.

This module explores the role of the citizen in democratic societies from a philosophical perspective. Students will explore different ways of understanding the value of citizenship and democracy as well as the ethics of public deliberation and voting. Students will also have the opportunity to examine alternatives to democracy and traditional models of citizenship and to consider arguments for and against citizenship deprivation and secession.

Component 2: God and Freedom (Dr Kenneth Pearce)

The major Abrahamic religions have traditionally held that God is perfectly good and perfectly wise or rational and at the same time that God is perfectly free. In particular it has seemed important to many philosophers and theologians working within these traditions that God be free to create a different world or no world at all. This gives rise to a puzzle. On the one hand it seems that a perfectly good and perfectly wise being must necessarily choose what is best. On the other hand it seems that a being who must necessarily choose the best is not free. In Can God Be Free? William Rowe argues that none of the proposed solutions to this problem is successful. The traditional conception of God Rowe concludes is incoherent and must be rejected. In addition to these problems about God's freedom many philosophers have thought that the existence of an omnipotent and omniscient creator would threaten our freedom. This component will examine these problems about God and Freedom along with various proposed theistic responses.

Lives can go well or poorly for their subjects. What makes this so? In this module we will examine the main answers philosophers have given to this question. The course begins by looking at what it might mean for experiences to be pleasurable or painful to their subjects. Next we’ll turn to what role (if any) the pleasurableness or painfulness of life contributes to how well that life goes for its subject and alternative things that might contribute to well-being such as a subject’s achievements capabilities or virtues.

1st Semester / Michaelmas Term 

Component 1 and 2 - Kant's Epistemology and Metaphysics Lecturer: Prof. Lilian Alweiss

This unit will consider Kant's Copernican revolution in epistemology and metaphysics and his distinctive form of idealism. In particular we shall be focusing on his account of space and time; his account of the relation between a priori and empirical knowledge and his response to skepticism. The set'text for this unit is: Immanuel Kant: The Critique of Pure Reason translated by Kemp Smith Macmillan. 

Component 3 - Marx and Nietzsche Lecturer: Dr. Georg Urich

The course traces the history of European philosophy in the mid and late nineteenth century with a focus on Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. While it is difficult to find two philosophers more different in stance or style Marx and Nietzsche do share certain features. Both reject much of the philosophical thinking of the past especially metaphysics both attack religion and both are highly critical of contemporary society. Instead in Marx’ historical materialism and in Nietzsche’s naturalistic outlook we find philosophy interpreted from a historical and evolutionary standpoint; both are outspoken atheists; and both advocate emancipation from oppressive forms of society and morality promoting a utopian ideal instead: a new society (Marx’ communist society) and a new man (Nietzsche’s Übermensch).

The discussion of Marx focuses on his early most overtly philosophical writings: We will consider his Contribution to a Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right Introduction (1843) primarily for its critique of religion; On the Jewish Question (1843) for his views on central political notions such as freedom justice political emancipation and human emancipation; and the Theses on Feuerbach (1845) which provide an overview of Marx’ reaction to the philosophy of his day particularly his rejection of existing versions of materialism and idealism as well as the development of historical materialism.

Of Nietzsche’s works we will consider primarily his Gay Science (1882) a comparatively clear and calm work of critical reflections on moral behaviour and religious belief typical of his science-inspired middle period which is perhaps best known for the idea that ‘God is dead’ and the doctrine of eternal recurrence; and two later works Beyond Good and Evil (1886) and On the Genealogy of Morals (1887) for his account of the origin of moral values and the notion of the will to power.

This is a problem'based course comprising the following components:

Component 1- Leibniz The Monadology (Prof. Simons)

Leibniz the last and greatest of the great rationalists wrote The Monadology three hundred years ago in 1714 perhaps at the request of Prince Eugene of Savoy. In its 90 paragraphs it presents synoptic and closely argued his complete philosophy. Starting from the simplest substances immaterial souls called monads it proceeds via discussion of their nature and relationships consciousness mind and body freedom good and evil to the nature of God and the fate of us all. We shall explore the corners of Leibniz's metaphysical system using the text as guide testing Russell's contention that like a fairy tale it is both consistent and unbelievable. We shall also indicate the amazing range of Leibniz's influence among the following great philosophers.

Component 2 – Plato’s Republic (Prof. Politis)

Plato’s Republic weaves together major themes in ethics politics psychology epistemology and metaphysics; and does so in a way that relates to issues of critical relevance not only to his contemporaries but arguably to us. In this course we shall focus on five themes: (1) the defence of injustice based on Plato’s description (through Thrasymachus) of the actual ethical and political world; (2) the account of a radical divide in humans between rational and irrational desires; (3) the response to this description of the actual human condition through 30 the articulation of a paradigm of a good community and man; (4) the conception of education in general and for this end; (5) the conception of philosophy and the philosopher underlying this grand project

We shall be reading Being and Nothingness by Jean-Paul Sartre which is sometimes described as a “bible” of existentialism. We shall focus in particular on the problems of freedom existence bad faith and the other.

Component 4 – Kirpke’s Naming and Necessity (Prof. Levine)

We will study Saul Kripke’s Naming and Necessity an influential and engaging book which is based on lectures he gave in 1970 and which has greatly shaped the discussion within analytic philosophy of issues concerning the nature of modality (necessity possibility and impossibility) and of language. Time permitting we will look at some related views of Hilary Putnam and at some responses to Kripke’s views.

1st Semester / Michaelmas Term

Component 1- Plato’s Phaedo (Dr. Larsen)

This incredible dialogue which purports to give an account of Socrates’ final day is striking both for its dramatic impact and for its philosophical depth. The primary and within the context pressing topic that occupies Socrates and his interlocutors in this text is the immortality of the soul and impressive arguments are marshalled both for and against the position that the soul persists after the body perishes. In the process of engaging in this most interesting and important inquiry many and additional crucial issues are raised and considered. Among the further but not less central topics that are covered are: the nature of the soul and its relation to the body; the existence of a-priori knowledge; the relation between perception and knowledge; the nature of philosophical inquiry and the structure of reality. In this course we will read the Phaedo closely and study in detail the ins and out of the arguments that comprise it.

Component 2 – Berkeley’s Three Dialogues (Dr. Storrie)

In this course we will study George Berkeley’s accessible and provocative series of dialogues between Hylas and Philonous. The interconnectedness between the Berkeley’s theory of perception epistemology metaphysics and moral philosophy will be considered. Berkeley’s idealism will be assessed and some key objections will be considered. For example if to be is to be perceived then how can different people perceive the same thing how can things exist when no one is perceiving it and how can the same thing exist through time?

2nd Semester / Hilary Term

Component 3 Aristotle’s De Anima (Dr. Larsen)

Aristotle’s De Anima – his study of the nature of the soul – is one of the foundational texts in the history of philosophy. It is rich both in the novel approach that it takes to the conception of the soul and in the impact that it has had on subsequent thinkers. It provides a careful reader with insights into the precise way in which Aristotle differed from his predecessors on various points of interest not just with respect to psychology but also physics and metaphysics. Additionally this short treatise like many of Aristotle’s works was crucially influential on the philosophical ideas that developed during the medieval period. This course will begin by highlighting the sense in which Aristotle’s hylomorphic conception of the soul is consistent with and follows from his views on change and explanation developed in his Physics and Metaphysics. It will then turn to a close examination of Aristotle’s account of the nature of the soul the relationship between the soul and the body and the capacities that distinguish the types of souls that comprise Aristotle’s tripartite division. Particular attention will be given to sense perception. We will consider the relation of Aristotle’s theory of sense perception as it is developed in the De Anima to both his contemporaries and to views prevalent in the modern debates in the philosophy of perception.

1st Semester / Michaelmas Term Components 1 and 2 - Formal Logic Lecturer: Paal Antonsen

“Either Abel murdered Cain or Cain murdered Abel. No one murdered Cain. Therefore Cain murdered Abel.” Most people would agree that this is an example of a valid argument. You probably do too – but why? What makes an argument a valid argument (or an invalid one)? In this course we will make use of formal logic to gain some clarity in how to assess the validity of arguments and precisifying arguments in natural language so that they can be so evaluated. We will learn how to translate sentences in natural language into a formal language and learn methods of checking validity.

The course is divided into three components:

Propositional logic: we introduce a simple formal language that allows us to handle complete sentences and connectives that bind them together. We then make use of truth tables to represent the truth conditions of complex formulas and a tree method to more easily check the validity of arguments.

Predicate logic: we expand our formal language to talk about names relations and properties as well as quantifying over individuals. We then make use of some simple model theory to represent the truth conditions of formulas in this language and expand our tree method as well to handle arguments in the expanded language.

Philosophical Logic: Lastly we consider some applications of formal methods in philosophical reasoning. We consider how to handle talk about the future vagueness things that don’t exist and justification of logic


Together these three components provide an introduction to classical logic and how one might go about in handling issues in philosophy in a more formal manner. 

 
2nd Semester / Hilary Term Components 3 and 4 - Philosophy of Science Lecturer: Dr. Niall Connolly

This course will subject the aims and methods of science to philosophical analysis; the basic question we want to answer is: what is science? We will start by asking whether scientific theories and the practice of science have distinctive features which allow us to draw a clear distinction between science and other human enterprises. It has been felt that a ‘demarcation criterion’ is particularly important for disqualifying as real science ‘pseudo-science’ like Creationism and Homeopathy. We will examine some alleged demarcation criteria. It is difficult to come up with a demarcation criterion or an exact definition of science but there are some things that are clearly true of science: science seeks to explain natural events and to formulate laws of nature. We will ask what it is to explain a natural event; and what is a law of nature? We will also investigate the general aim of science. Does science attempt to give a true account of the world; or just a useful or ‘empirically adequate' account? A related question is whether scientific theories are committed to the existence of the unobservable entities they posit. Science it is often claimed aims for an objective view of the world and this aim is facilitated by its methods. Feminist philosophers of science have subjected the notion of objectivity and the claim that science is objective to critical scrutiny; we will examine this critique.

Component 1 and 2: Logic (Ms Zuzanna Gnatek)

This course is an introduction to logic aimed at philosophy students. We will make use of formal methods to make the notion of ‘validity’ precise in two systems of logic: propositional logic and predicate logic. We will first learn how to identify the logical form of arguments and then learn how to check their validity. In the case of propositional logic we will make use of truth tables and a tree method. In the case of predicate logic we will make use of some basic model theory and an expanded tree method.

Time permitting we will also look at some basic concepts in meta-logic – properties about the logical systems themselves. Furthermore we may briefly introduce some other systems such as set theory or modal logic.

In the final part of the course we turn our attention to some issues in philosophical logic where we employ formal methods to serve philosophical ends. We will look at how logic can aid us in coming to grip with philosophical puzzles such as e.g. vagueness indeterminacy or identity and existence.

Component 3: Philosophy of Language (Mr Peter West)

This course will cover a selection of key topics in the philosophy of language. Philosophy of language is the study of how certain sounds or utterances (or marks when written down) come to form a language; i.e. a way for people to communicate with each other. Central questions include: what makes language meaningful? And how do we use language to communicate with each other? Two approaches to the philosophy of language will be considered: (1) semantics and (2) pragmatics. Semantics is the study of the literal meaning of sentences largely independently of context while pragmatics tries to explain how speakers often use sentences to convey more than or even something different from what they literally mean. Attention will also be paid to the history of language as a philosophical topic.

Component 4: Philosophy of Science (Dr Keith Begley)

This component is an introduction to philosophy of science; it is not a science course so no specific knowledge of science is required. Examples of the kind of questions considered in philosophy of science are: What is science? How should science be demarcated from other practices? What is the best scientific methodology to adopt? Does science produce knowledge? What are the limits of scientific enquiry? In this component we will first look at some early notions of scientific inquiry before discussing a number of important developments in the philosophy of science especially in the 20th century. We will pay particular attention to the views known as Inductivism Popperian Falisificationism and Kuhnian ‘Paradigm Shift’ and to the debate between the Scientific Realists and Anti-realists.

At the end of this component students will be able to critically discuss one of Friedrich Nietzsche’s last works.
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Component 1 – Kant (Prof. Lilian Alweiss)

This unit will consider Kantʼs Copernican revolution in epistemology and metaphysics and his distinctive form of idealism. In particularly we shall be focusing on his account of space and time; his account of the relation between a priori and empirical knowledge and his response to scepticism.

The set-text for this unit is:

Immanuel Kant: The Critique of Pure Reason translated by Kemp Smith Macmillan.

Component 2 – Nietzsche (Prof. Vasilis Politis)

The aim of these lectures is to study and critically discuss one of Friedrich Nietzsche’s last works and perhaps his greatest work: Beyond Good and Evil (1886). We will also be making some reference to the work he wrote soon after On the Genealogy of Morals (1887) which he wrote to complement and clarify Beyond Good and Evil. We shall combine a careful reading of Beyond Good and Evil based on selected passages with a thematic approach based on exegetical and critical questions. We shall also read one or two pieces of secondary literature drawing on the excellent collection of papers in: Simon May (ed.) Nietzsche’s On the Genealogy of Morality Cambridge 2011.

TOPICS AND QUESTIONS

We shall concentrate on the following themes and questions:

What is the target of Nietzsche’s ‘battle’ in Beyond Good and Evil? Is the battle against Platonism and Christianity as important as Nietzsche thinks?

What positive gains does Nietzsche hope to achieve through the battle with Platonism and Christianity?

What does Nietzsche mean by ‘beyond good and evil’?

How can something be beyond good and evil and at the same time be good even supremely good?

How does he argue that we should go beyond good and evil?

How does Nietzsche think about love? Why is love so important to him?

Why does he think that love is beyond good and evil?

How and in what different and diverse ways does Nietzsche characterize the distinction between the noble disposition and the slavish disposition?

Why does he think this distinction is ‘basic’ and that these two types of dispositions are ‘basic’?

What does he mean by the claim that the distinction between good and bad takes on a different meaning depending on whether it is made from the perspective of the noble disposition or it is made from the perspective of the slavish disposition?

What does he mean by the claim that the noble disposition is ‘creative of value’ (‘werteschaffend’)?

What are the key elements in Nietzsche’s method in philosophy?

To what extent and in what sense is his method in philosophy naturalist?

To what extent and in what sense is his method in philosophy anti-dogmatic and sceptical?

Why does he think the philosopher is a creator of value?

This component is an introduction to the interpretation of the surviving fragments of the writings of Heraclitus of Ephesus an influential pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived c. 535 – c. 475 BCE and is famous for his cryptic and seemingly paradoxical aphorisms. We will focus on five broad themes that are to be found in Heraclitus studies: Flux Unity of Opposites Logos Psychology or ‘Soul’ and the distinctions between the philosopher’s view and those of the ‘polymaths’. We will address these themes by reading and interpreting the relevant fragments closely considering questions that arise and discussing some of the many differing interpretations that scholars have given of Heraclitus’ thought.

Component 2: John Rawls's A Theory of Justice (Dr Brian Carey)

In this course we will be reading key sections from John Rawls’s A Theory of Justice (1979 Revised Edition 1999). One of – if not the most – influential works of political philosophy in the 20th century A Theory of Justice sets out a liberal egalitarian view of justice in democratic societies. Intended to challenge the utilitarian orthodoxy of the time Rawls’ theory would go on to attract critics from across the political spectrum ranging from the libertarian right to the socialist left. Despite this it remains the single most important work of political philosophy in the modern liberal egalitarian tradition.

We will begin by examining Rawls’ view in some detail focusing on those sections of the book that set out the core aspects of his theory. In the latter part of the course we will also consider a number of significant criticisms that emerged following the publication of A Theory of Justice and see how Rawls responded to these critiques in his later work.

The aim of these lectures is to study and critically discuss Plato's Republic books 1 8 and 9. Our main questions will be: Q1. How seriously does Plato (in book 1 of the Republic) take the view that the most important public virtue justice takes on a very different look depending on whether it is considered by the rulers or the ruled? Q2. Does Plato (in books 8 and 9 of the Republic) succeed in demonstrating intuitively and not based on theory that the only hope for us humans both publicly and privately is to sort out our own inner selves and to strive for internal harmony?'

Component 2: Berkeley's Principles (Dr Peter West)

This component will focus on George Berkeley’s A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge which was published in 1710 (when he was a fellow of Trinity College). Students should be familiar with some of Berkeley’s arguments from his Three Dialogues (1713) from the JF 18th Century component but in this component we will focus on the work in which Berkeley first presented his immaterialism (the view that there is no such thing as ‘matter’). Special attention will be paid to the structure of Berkeley’s argument his characterisation of his opponents’ (‘materialists’) views and the plausibility of Berkeley’s claims in light of the historical context. Students should gain a deeper understanding of Berkeley’s philosophy while also developing broader philosophical skills such as reading historical texts and reconstructing and evaluating arguments.

TOPICS AND QUESTIONS

We shall concentrate on the following issues and questions:

LOVE IN THE SYMPOSIUM

Is there a single overall question about love in the Symposium?

What is this question and when and how is it first introduced?

What is love (eros) as they are discussing it and disputing about it?

Is it acceptable to read the series of speeches as culminating in Socrates/Diotima’s speech?

Does Phaedrus have a good argument for his claim that love is supremely good for us humans?

How and how convincingly does Pausanias contradict Phaedrus’ view that love is supremely good?

Do you agree with Pausanias that there are two separate kinds of love good love and bad love?

What serious fault in the human condition is Aristophanes’ account of love a response to?

Is Aristophanes’ account of love correctly characterized as ‘romantic’?

What music would be good accompaniment to Aristophanes’ speech?

How attractive do you find Aristophanes’ account of love?

Does Agathon have a good argument for his claim that love is supremely beautiful and supremely good?

Is Agathon right in moving directly from ‘Love is supremely beautiful’ to ‘Love is supremely good’?

How does Socrates argue that love is lacking in both beauty and goodness?

What does Diotima mean by the claim that love is ‘mid-way’ between good and bad?

Is Diotima arguing that love is volatile and unstable?

How does Diotima argue that love is a creative force?

Is it a fair objection to Plato that his account of love (according to Socrates/Diotima) is excessively self-regarding and leaves out the place of others?

What are the steps in the ascent of love according to Diotima?

How does Socrates/Diotima conclude that only the vision of pure beauty can issue in genuine virtue and wisdom and not in conventional virtue and wisdom?

What in your view is especially striking about Alcibiades’ account of his unhappy love for Socrates?

How does Alcibiades’ account of his unhappy love for Socrates contribute to the overall question about love in the dialogue?

 
POWER IN THE GORGIAS

How does Socrates argue that Gorgias’ account of the power of rhetoric involves a contradiction?

Is it easy to get rid of that contradiction? Is it as easy as Polus thinks?

Is Socrates’ argument against Polus’ conception of power based on Polus’ own premises?

How does Socrates invoke the distinction between what one desire/wants and what seems best to one to argue against Polus conception of power?

How important in your view is the distinction between what one desire/wants and what seems best to one?

Can one be seriously mistaken about what is good for one?

Can one be seriously mistaken about what one wants?

Where does Socrates’ views come from that The worst thing for one is to do wrong and It is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong and If one has done wrong it is better to be punished than go unpunished?

Are these views as counter-intuitive as Polus thinks?

Is it consistent for Socrates to hold these views with the passion with which he holds them while at the same time he claims not to know that they are true?

How does Socrates employ the notion of what is noble/beautiful and what is base/ugly to defend his view against Polus charge of counter-intuitiveness?

Is Polus too easily persuaded by Socrates?

Is Callicles’ distinction between what is noble by nature and what is noble by convention a good way of avoiding Socrates’ views?

Is there a way for Callicles to distinguish between noble/beautiful pleasures and pursuits and base/ugly pleasures and pursuits?

At the end of this course students will be able to:
Critically assess employing historical examples the role of imagery in philosophy
discuss whether philosophical doctrine is related to a philosopher's psychological type
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
By psychological philosophy I understand philosophy before it split off from psychology circa 1900 and became largely logical conceptual or linguistic. Hence the course has an important historical dimension and much of the material is drawn from the history of philosophy beginning with Descartes and coming up to the present. Another way of seeing the course is by topic or subject matter. And here broadly there are three or four general headings: mental images and the way it offers the beginnings of a mental typology and also a critique of what following Galton and James I call the Typical Mind Fallacy; tactual and visual sense-data and how that offers an argument for Neo-Berkeleian idealism; also the discovery of retronasal olfaction as another way into idealism; and finally the basic theory of mental types which- partly following Plato- I call the dualistic or mental the monistic or physical and the socio-linguistic. Other topics examined are: whether Descartes’s dualism can be traced to his unconscious fear of death; A. J. Ayer’s Near Death Experience and whether it offers evidence for the spiritistic part of Berkeley’s idealism and finally the feasibility of the animistic idea of the next life as an image dream world..

Some of the questions we’ll look at will include:

- What’s the source of our moral feelings? Can these feelings be reliable?

- What’s valuable in life and how should we bring that about for others?

- Which actions are good actions and which states of affairs are good states of affairs?

- Is there a difference between harming someone and allowing someone to be harmed?

- How demanding is morality?

- Are certain actions always impermissible? (To kill another person for example?)

- To what extent are we responsible for things that we’re ignorant about?

The aim is to show that the traditional (Cartesian) model of perception is out of tune with the way we actually perceive the world. The course will explore the extent to which phenomenology provides a different account of the nature of perceptual consciousness which has a bearing on how we understand our relation to the world and our knowledge of the world around us.

PI3016,Philosophy Of Fiction,Paal Antonsen,"Learning Outcomes:
At the end of this course students will be able to:

·  Provide different analyses of the semantics of sentences uttered in fiction discourse.

·  Assess the philosophical significance of the psychology of fiction.

·  Discuss fictions from a philosophical point of view in particular the epistemological and metaphysical status of fictions.
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Reflecting on our ordinary practices of engaging with fiction quickly leads to puzzles. In this course we will tackle three such puzzles that emerge drawing on examples from literature comics video games movies and theatre plays.

Part i semantics

‘Kaidan is on Mars’ says Clara. Of course Kaidan isn’t actually. In fact he’s nowhere in the whole universe Mars or otherwise. Kaidan is a fictional character from the video game series Mass Effect. But given that Clara made her utterance in fiction discourse she has intuitively said something true. How can we make sense of claims being true because they accurately portray what goes on in a fiction? What changes if any do we need to make to a standard semantic framework to accommodate this?

Part ii emotions

Legend has it that Aeschylus’ tragedies were so horrific that pregnant women in the audience would spontaneously miscarry. It’s doubtful that this has happened to you but fictions often have a great effect on us. We shiver and jitter when the murderer hiding in the dark sneaks up on his prey; we cry when our favourite characters suffer hardships; we rejoice when things go their way. Thousands maybe millions have crushes on fictional characters from films and video games – many of them have their own fan clubs. How can fictions affect our emotions at all when we know that the events occurring in them don’t actually happen?

Part iii epistemology

In an interview Noam Chomsky speculated that maybe the sciences would never develop to the point that we can learn more about human psychology from them than from literature. It’s obvious enough that fictions can affect us psychologically but can we learn anything from them? How could a fiction be a source or transmitter of knowledge? If they can at all it’s not done in a straightforward way. We don’t acquire any knowledge by reading that a young boy named Pip was raised by a smith helped a fugitive and in the end melted the heart of a girl bent on humiliating male suitors. None of that happened so trivially we can’t know that it did. What kind of knowledge then could we gain by reading a work like Dickens’ Great Expectations?

If you’re reading these words then chances are that you have a mind. But what exactly is a mind? This module will pursue an answer to this question by exploring various characteristics and capacities that have been identified as distinctive of mentality including but not limited to: consciousness rationality a sense of self the ability to have perceptions thoughts and beliefs about the world the disposition to exhibit certain forms of behavior and the possession of a sufficiently complex brain. Along the way we will also consider a number of questions that have been the subject of sustained interest and debate among those engaged in philosophical and scientific studies of the mind. These will include such questions as the following: What is the relationship between the mind and the brain? Can non-living entities e.g. computers have minds? How do mental states e.g. beliefs desires and sensations cause physical effects e.g. bodily motions? Is consciousness essential to mentality? Can mental states and processes be fully explained in non-mental physical terms? How do thoughts and perceptions come to represent various objects in and features of our environment? What determines the content of our thoughts and perceptions? Our investigation of these questions and the features of mentality they shed light on will set us on the path towards an improved understanding of the mind and its place in nature.

This module examines contemporary moral issues from a philosophical perspective. We begin with a quick look at the major moral theories but will focus on examining concrete ethical questions such as the moral permissibility of abortion euthanasia and factory farming. Addressing such issues involves philosophical examination of the grounds of moral concern and respect well-being and the badness of death among other things. Finally we will turn to foundational issues in metaethics such as whether there is moral truth and how we can hope to come to know it.

Who should get what and why? Theories of distributive justice seek to explain how states should distribute (and redistribute) valuable resources within their borders and beyond. This course will introduce students to the most significant theories of distributive justice in contemporary political philosophy. These theories include liberal egalitarianism libertarianism ‘luck’ egalitarianism and the capabilities approach.

We will begin by considering three core concepts that are central to most theories of distributive justice: rights freedom and equality. We will then examine how different theories of distributive justice attempt to strike the right balance between each. In the latter part of the course we will also consider some of the challenges that have been raised against these theories in recent years including the feminist critique of liberalism and challenges posed by globalisation and intergenerational justice.

TOPICS AND QUESTIONS

We shall concentrate on the following issues and questions:

LOVE IN THE SYMPOSIUM

Is there a single overall question about love in the Symposium?

What is this question and when and how is it first introduced?

What is love (eros) as they are discussing it and disputing about it?

Is it acceptable to read the series of speeches as culminating in Socrates/Diotima’s speech?

Does Phaedrus have a good argument for his claim that love is supremely good for us humans?

How and how convincingly does Pausanias contradict Phaedrus’ view that love is supremely good?

Do you agree with Pausanias that there are two separate kinds of love good love and bad love?

What serious fault in the human condition is Aristophanes’ account of love a response to?

Is Aristophanes’ account of love correctly characterized as ‘romantic’?

What music would be good accompaniment to Aristophanes’ speech?

How attractive do you find Aristophanes’ account of love?

Does Agathon have a good argument for his claim that love is supremely beautiful and supremely good?

Is Agathon right in moving directly from ‘Love is supremely beautiful’ to ‘Love is supremely good’?

How does Socrates argue that love is lacking in both beauty and goodness?

What does Diotima mean by the claim that love is ‘mid-way’ between good and bad?

Is Diotima arguing that love is volatile and unstable?

How does Diotima argue that love is a creative force?

Is it a fair objection to Plato that his account of love (according to Socrates/Diotima) is excessively self-regarding and leaves out the place of others?

What are the steps in the ascent of love according to Diotima?

How does Socrates/Diotima conclude that only the vision of pure beauty can issue in genuine virtue and wisdom and not in conventional virtue and wisdom?

What in your view is especially striking about Alcibiades’ account of his unhappy love for Socrates?

How does Alcibiades’ account of his unhappy love for Socrates contribute to the overall question about love in the dialogue?

 
POWER IN THE GORGIAS

How does Socrates argue that Gorgias’ account of the power of rhetoric involves a contradiction?

Is it easy to get rid of that contradiction? Is it as easy as Polus thinks?

Is Socrates’ argument against Polus’ conception of power based on Polus’ own premises?

How does Socrates invoke the distinction between what one desire/wants and what seems best to one to argue against Polus conception of power?

How important in your view is the distinction between what one desire/wants and what seems best to one?

Can one be seriously mistaken about what is good for one?

Can one be seriously mistaken about what one wants?

Where does Socrates’ views come from that The worst thing for one is to do wrong and It is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong and If one has done wrong it is better to be punished than go unpunished?

Are these views as counter-intuitive as Polus thinks?

Is it consistent for Socrates to hold these views with the passion with which he holds them while at the same time he claims not to know that they are true?

How does Socrates employ the notion of what is noble/beautiful and what is base/ugly to defend his view against Polus charge of counter-intuitiveness?

Is Polus too easily persuaded by Socrates?

Is Callicles’ distinction between what is noble by nature and what is noble by convention a good way of avoiding Socrates’ views?

Is there a way for Callicles to distinguish between noble/beautiful pleasures and pursuits and base/ugly pleasures and pursuits?

Sometimes it’s no wonder that people can’t agree on the right action to take because there are so many things to consider. In this course students will examine some of the most pressing debates in a wide range of areas in contemporary moral philosophy. We will critically examine meta-ethical normative and applied ethical theories.

Some of the questions we’ll look at will include:

- What’s the source of our moral feelings? Can these feelings be reliable?

- What’s valuable in life and how should we bring that about for others?

- Which actions are good actions and which states of affairs are good states of affairs?

- Is there a difference between harming someone and allowing someone to be harmed?

- How demanding is morality?

- Are certain actions always impermissible? (To kill another person for example?)

- To what extent are we responsible for things that we’re ignorant about?

 As well as learning to analyse these questions students will learn about the answers and arguments given to these questions from important contemporary and historical figures.

This course develops the introductory material on philosophy of religion from the freshman years. Its focus is a dialogue between the philosophy of religion of Aquinas and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Aquinas is treated as an exemplar of classical theism whose approach is amenable to analytical philosophical analysis. We look at his account of God’s exstence and nature and his view on the nature of philosophical method. Wittgenstein’s views on religious belief changed from the Tractatus to the Investigations to his later remarks. There are obvious differences with Aquinas and curious similarities which will be explored.

Module Content:
The aim of these seminars is to study and critically discuss Plato’s theory of Forms understood as a theory of essence. The seminar will be conducted as a combination of a close reading of a selection of texts from Plato (especially the Phaedo and the Republic but also other dialogues) and a close reading of my manuscript Plato’s Essentialism. I hope students will help me in improving this manuscript one last time before I submit it for publication through their critical comments and questions and in general their suggestions.

We shall concentrate on the following issues and questions:

What is Plato’s theory of Forms a theory of?

Is Plato’s theory of Forms a coherent and well-defended theory?

What reasons are there to suppose that Plato’s Forms are basically essences?

What is meant by an essence here?

Through what several characteristics does Plato characterize the Forms?

What is his motivation and justification for each of these characteristics? (Concentrating on one or two characteristics at a time.)

Is there any characteristics that Plato definitely fails to justify and defend?

How (if at all) can Plato’s Forms/essences be both theoretical entities and really real?

• Understand the key ideas and concepts used by theorists who focus on some of the lesser-studied subjects in political theory.

• Develop the oral and written skills necessary to analyse philosophical arguments and to present their own philosophical ideas in a clear coherent and compelling fashion.

 
Module Learning Aims:

Political philosophy is sometimes criticized on the basis that it is too abstract that it misrepresents real people and real political institutions and that it fails to provide action-guiding recommendations that can be applied to the world in which we live. In this module students will explore and critically examine some of the ways that political theorists have responded (or failed to respond) to these challenges. We will begin by considering recent debates in the methodology of political philosophy before considering ways in which a philosopher may themselves be affected by bias or prejudice. The remainder of this module focuses on some of those subjects who have often been ignored or under-examined by political theorists in the past including children people of colour people with disabilities and migrants.

At the end of this course students will be able to:

Identify similarities and differences in different uses of self–refutation arguments.

Critically assess whether metaphysical conclusions can be drawn from self–refutation arguments.

Describe and assess the role of self–refutation arguments in this history of philosophy
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Throughout the history of philosophy the charge has often been made that a given position is “self–refuting” or that it cannot be coherently thought or stated. Such a criticism is often made for example against certain forms of relativism; but it is also made by Berkeley against the “realism” he opposes as well as by critics of Kant who claim it is “self–refuting” for him to hold that we can know nothing about things “as they are in themselves”. The purpose of this seminar is to examine such “self–refutation” arguments—in particular to consider if they have a common structure and to examine what if anything they establish. To do so we will look at a number of sources including recent writings of such philosophers as Donald Davidson (“On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme”) Thomas Nagel (The View from Nowhere. The Last Word) Paul Boghossian (Fear of Knowledge) Barry Stroud (Engagement and Metaphysical Dissatisfaction) and Graham Priest (Beyond the Limits of Thought) as well as earlier writings from Parmenides Plato Berkeley Kant Russell Wittgenstein A. N. Prior J. L. Mackie and John Anderson the influential Australian philosopher. Some of the readings we will look at will attempt to articulate the structure of self–refutation arguments; others either use such arguments against others or defend themselves against the charge that their own position is self–refuting.

This course intends to offer a critical introduction to phenomenology (the description of things as they appear the ‘what it’s like’ of experience) as inaugurated by Husserl subsequently transformed by Heidegger into hermeneutical phenomenology and later developed by Sartre and Merleau-Ponty as existential phenomenology. Selected texts from Brentano Husserl Heidegger Sartre and Merleau-Ponty will be read and critically discussed in terms of their contribution to the development of phenomenological philosophy. Emphasis will be placed on phenomenology as a method for describing consciousness in all its modalities including the emotions. The course will also focus on some particular problems that have received distinctive treatment from phenomenologists: intentionality consciousness the emotions the experience of the other in empathy intersubjectivity and embodiment.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
When we speak or think we cannot avoid making use of the personal pronoun. We say 'I think' 'I am in pain' 'I am hungry' or 'I was born in the last century'. In all these instances reference to a bearer of thought seems inevitable. Yet there are many who wish to convince us that what seems inevitable in everyday speech is nothing other than a linguistic convention.The words ‘I’ and ‘my’ are mere adornments of speech. There is a ‘necessity of syntax’ which compels us to speak of a positional self however as soon as we have a closer look we come to realise that the pronoun ‘I’ is not a place-holder for anything in particular. Indeed without much trouble we can replace ‘I was thinking’ with ‘there was thinking going on’ and ‘I am in pain’ with ‘there is pain’ since there is no self separable from the thought or the sensation of pain. Proof of this is that we cannot perceive such a self but only objects of thoughts feelings sensations or impressions. Versions of such a no-ownership theory of consciousness are presented by (Hume Anscombe Wittgenstein the early Husserl and the early Sartre). Against this view this course wishes to show why we need to hold fast to the claim that there is something distinctive about the use of the first person pronoun. No description not even one containing indexicals (other than the first person pronouns themselves) can be substituted for 'I'. We shall do this by focusing in particular on the writings of Descartes Kant and Husserl.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
In this module we’ll explore metaphysical questions relating to freedom and time. Are we free if scientific laws determine what we do? Why do we control the future and not the past? Do metaphysical views about time explain the openness of the future—or should asymmetries of time and control be explained in scientific terms? We’ll examine the work of a number of contemporary philosophers who use the challenge of reconciling science with metaphysics to develop radically new ideas about time agency and the relations between them. Authors and topics to be considered include Jenann Ismael on how ‘epistemic freedom’ explains the apparent openness of the future Huw Price on how causation depends on taking the perspective of agents and Craig Callender on how psychology explains the apparent specialness of the present. Through exploring this work students will develop their own views about time freedom and agency the aspirations of philosophy and the role of science in philosophical theorising.

Perhaps since Plato and certainly since Descartes there has been a thesis in philosophy that there are two substances the one mental (the mind) and the other physical (the body). This view arose in response to certain difficulties in philosophy but has raised more problems such as how these substances interact and whether one can exist without the other. These problems have proved so intractable that philosophers have been disposed to respond to them by rejecting one or other substance or less dramatically by 'reducing' one to the other. None of the attempts to grapple with the 'mind-body' problem have found universal acceptance although an ultimate reduction of the mental to the physical has been widely if tacitly accepted by scientists. The rapid development of neuroscience and artificial intelligence has been considered to support this view. In these seminars we will explore that apparent support.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module explores philosophical thinking about language and its relationship to thought in pre-Kantian modern European philosophy. Special attention will be paid to the consequences theories of mind and language were thought to have for other areas of philosophy especially epistemology philosophy of science and philosophy of religion. We will focus on three philosophers: Antoine Arnauld John Locke and George Berkeley.

Antoine Arnauld (1612-1694) was a polemical Jansenist theologian and Augustinian-Cartesian philosopher. Together with his collaborators Claude Lancelot and Pierre Nicole at Port-Royal Abbey in France Arnauld developed an influential theory of mind and language. This theory is mainly presented in two works the Port-Royal Grammar (1660) and the Port-Royal Logic (1662). According to this theory there are innate universal structures in the human mind prior to language and these structures are reflected in the grammars of human languages. (Noam Chomsky has argued that the Port-Royal Grammar can be seen as a predecessor to his own work in linguistics which also attempts to derive grammatical structure from universal innate mental structures.) We will focus on the relationship between language and ideas beliefs and reasoning in the Logic.

The Port-Royal theory was built on a Cartesian theory of ideas as non-imagistic conceptions innate to the pure intellect (independent of the senses). In Book III of his Essay concerning Human Understanding (1689) John Locke attempted to sever the Port-Royal theory from these Cartesian roots in order to develop an empiricist theory of language. He took this theory to have important consequences for the theory of classification (natural kinds) in science and for the nature and limits of religious belief.

Following the publication of Locke's Essay the Irish philosopher John Toland published a notorious and immediately controversial book Christianity Not Mysterious (1696) in which he argued that it followed from Locke's theory that certain religious sentences such as those used in Trinitarian theology were meaningless and so could not actually express beliefs. In Ireland and elsewhere a variety of responses to Toland were published. By far the most famous of these was due to George Berkeley. Only recently in the work of David Berman and others has it been recognized that the Introduction to Berkeley's Treatise on the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710) is intended in part as a response to Toland. In a later work Alciphron Berkeley responds to Toland more explicitly.

Berkeley's general strategy is to argue that words can be meaningful and express genuine beliefs without corresponding to ideas. Some commentators have argued that Berkeley provides a 'use theory' of language similar to the later Wittgenstein. We will discuss how Berkeley addresses these issues in the manuscript and published versions of the Introduction to the Principles and in the seventh dialogue of Alciphron. (The original of the manuscript version of the Introduction is held by TCD's Old Library.)

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
We typically assume that our minds have a causal impact on the world by affecting the motion of our bodies and thence the states of other physical objects in our environment. When a person gets up from the couch to rummage about in the fridge it is we say their desire for food and belief that there is desirable food in the fridge (which are states of their mind) that cause them to stand up walk to the kitchen and open the fridge. Similarly when someone stubs their toe it is we say the resulting sensation of pain (another mental state) that causes them to wince and say “Ow!” One of the most long-standing objections to mind-body dualism is that the dualist’s thesis that mind and body are distinct and irreducible to one another makes it difficult if not impossible to explain how the mind could cause such effects. This module will examine and evaluate various responses to this objection in the interest of arriving at a better understanding of how the mind interacts with the physical world. In pursuit of this goal we will consider a number of dualist and materialist theories of mental causation different varieties of dualism and how they are variously affected by the aforementioned objection the plausibility of the epiphenomenalist view that the mind is causally inert and various rival theories of causation in general.

At the end of this component students will be able to:

• Explain several important challenges that political theorists must face if we aim to produce action-guiding recommendations for the real world.

• Understand the key ideas and concepts used by theorists who focus on some of the lesser-studied subjects in political theory.

• Develop the oral and written skills necessary to analyse philosophical arguments and to present their own philosophical ideas in a clear coherent and compelling fashion.

 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Political philosophy is sometimes criticized on the basis that it is too abstract that it misrepresents real people and real political institutions and that it fails to provide action-guiding recommendations that can be applied to the world in which we live. In this module students will explore and critically examine some of the ways that political theorists have responded (or failed to respond) to these challenges. We will begin by considering recent debates in the methodology of political philosophy before considering ways in which a philosopher may themselves be affected by bias or prejudice. The remainder of this module focuses on some of those subjects who have often been ignored or under-examined by political theorists in the past including children people of colour people with disabilities and migrants.

Identify similarities and differences in different uses of self–refutation arguments.

Critically assess whether metaphysical conclusions can be drawn from self–refutation arguments.

Describe and assess the role of self–refutation arguments in this history of philosophy
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Throughout the history of philosophy the charge has often been made that a given position is “self–refuting” or that it cannot be coherently thought or stated. Such a criticism is often made for example against certain forms of relativism; but it is also made by Berkeley against the “realism” he opposes as well as by critics of Kant who claim it is “self–refuting” for him to hold that we can know nothing about things “as they are in themselves”. The purpose of this seminar is to examine such “self–refutation” arguments—in particular to consider if they have a common structure and to examine what if anything they establish. To do so we will look at a number of sources including recent writings of such philosophers as Donald Davidson (“On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme”) Thomas Nagel (The View from Nowhere. The Last Word) Paul Boghossian (Fear of Knowledge) Barry Stroud (Engagement and Metaphysical Dissatisfaction) and Graham Priest (Beyond the Limits of Thought) as well as earlier writings from Parmenides Plato Berkeley Kant Russell Wittgenstein A. N. Prior J. L. Mackie and John Anderson the influential Australian philosopher. Some of the readings we will look at will attempt to articulate the structure of self–refutation arguments; others either use such arguments against others or defend themselves against the charge that their own position is self–refuting.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
When we speak or think we cannot avoid making use of the personal pronoun. We say 'I think' 'I am in pain' 'I am hungry' or 'I was born in the last century'. In all these instances reference to a bearer of thought seems inevitable. Yet there are many who wish to convince us that what seems inevitable in everyday speech is nothing other than a linguistic convention.The words ‘I’ and ‘my’ are mere adornments of speech. There is a ‘necessity of syntax’ which compels us to speak of a positional self however as soon as we have a closer look we come to realise that the pronoun ‘I’ is not a place-holder for anything in particular. Indeed without much trouble we can replace ‘I was thinking’ with ‘there was thinking going on’ and ‘I am in pain’ with ‘there is pain’ since there is no self separable from the thought or the sensation of pain. Proof of this is that we cannot perceive such a self but only objects of thoughts feelings sensations or impressions. Versions of such a no-ownership theory of consciousness are presented by (Hume Anscombe Wittgenstein the early Husserl and the early Sartre). Against this view this course wishes to show why we need to hold fast to the claim that there is something distinctive about the use of the first person pronoun. No description not even one containing indexicals (other than the first person pronouns themselves) can be substituted for 'I'. We shall do this by focusing in particular on the writings of Descartes Kant and Husserl.

Yet there are many who wish to convince us that what seems inevitable in everyday speech is nothing other than a linguistic convention.The words ‘I’ and ‘my’ are mere adornments of speech. There is a ‘necessity of syntax’ which compels us to speak of a positional self however as soon as we have a closer look we come to realise that the pronoun ‘I’ is not a place-holder for anything in particular. Indeed without much trouble we can replace ‘I was thinking’ with ‘there was thinking going on’ and ‘I am in pain’ with ‘there is pain’ since there is no self separable from the thought or the sensation of pain. Proof of this is that we cannot perceive such a self but only objects of thoughts feelings sensations or impressions. Versions of such a no-ownership theory of consciousness are presented by (Hume Anscombe Wittgenstein the early Husserl and the early Sartre). Against this view this course wishes to show why we need to hold fast to the claim that there is something distinctive about the use of the first person pronoun. No description not even one containing indexicals (other than the first person pronouns themselves) can be substituted for 'I'. We shall do this by focusing in particular on the writings of Descartes Kant and Husserl.

PI8005,Metaphysics,Alison Fernandes,"Learning Outcomes:
At the end of this course students will be able to:

Explain metaphysical accounts of time and freedom and assess their compatibility with contemporary science.

Discuss and critically evaluate recent revisionist conceptions of time freedom and their relation.

Argue for their own views about how to reconcile our experience of time and freedom with a scientific view of the world.

Express their views about the role of science and experience in philosophical theorising.

 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
In this module we’ll explore metaphysical questions relating to freedom and time. Are we free if scientific laws determine what we do? Why do we control the future and not the past? Do metaphysical views about time explain the openness of the future—or should asymmetries of time and control be explained in scientific terms? We’ll examine the work of a number of contemporary philosophers who use the challenge of reconciling science with metaphysics to develop radically new ideas about time agency and the relations between them. Authors and topics to be considered include Jenann Ismael on how ‘epistemic freedom’ explains the apparent openness of the future Huw Price on how causation depends on taking the perspective of agents and Craig Callender on how psychology explains the apparent specialness of the present. Through exploring this work students will develop their own views about time freedom and agency the aspirations of philosophy and the role of science in philosophical theorising.

PI8006,Neurophilosophy,Thomas Farrell,"Learning Outcomes:
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Perhaps since Plato and certainly since Descartes there has been a thesis in philosophy that there are two substances the one mental (the mind) and the other physical (the body). This view arose in response to certain difficulties in philosophy but has raised more problems such as how these substances interact and whether one can exist without the other. These problems have proved so intractable that philosophers have been disposed to respond to them by rejecting one or other substance or less dramatically by 'reducing' one to the other. None of the attempts to grapple with the 'mind-body' problem have found universal acceptance although an ultimate reduction of the mental to the physical has been widely if tacitly accepted by scientists. The rapid development of neuroscience and artificial intelligence has been considered to support this view. In these seminars we will explore that apparent support.

At the end of this component students will be able to:

• Explain several important challenges that political theorists must face if we aim to produce action-guiding recommendations for the real world.

• Understand the key ideas and concepts used by theorists who focus on some of the lesser-studied subjects in political theory.

• Develop the oral and written skills necessary to analyse philosophical arguments and to present their own philosophical ideas in a clear coherent and compelling fashion.

 
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Political philosophy is sometimes criticized on the basis that it is too abstract that it misrepresents real people and real political institutions and that it fails to provide action-guiding recommendations that can be applied to the world in which we live. In this module students will explore and critically examine some of the ways that political theorists have responded (or failed to respond) to these challenges. We will begin by considering recent debates in the methodology of political philosophy before considering ways in which a philosopher may themselves be affected by bias or prejudice. The remainder of this module focuses on some of those subjects who have often been ignored or under-examined by political theorists in the past including children people of colour people with disabilities and migrants.

Module Learning Aims:
 
 
Module Content:
This module explores philosophical thinking about language and its relationship to thought in pre-Kantian modern European philosophy. Special attention will be paid to the consequences theories of mind and language were thought to have for other areas of philosophy especially epistemology philosophy of science and philosophy of religion. We will focus on three philosophers: Antoine Arnauld John Locke and George Berkeley.

Antoine Arnauld (1612-1694) was a polemical Jansenist theologian and Augustinian-Cartesian philosopher. Together with his collaborators Claude Lancelot and Pierre Nicole at Port-Royal Abbey in France Arnauld developed an influential theory of mind and language. This theory is mainly presented in two works the Port-Royal Grammar (1660) and the Port-Royal Logic (1662). According to this theory there are innate universal structures in the human mind prior to language and these structures are reflected in the grammars of human languages. (Noam Chomsky has argued that the Port-Royal Grammar can be seen as a predecessor to his own work in linguistics which also attempts to derive grammatical structure from universal innate mental structures.) We will focus on the relationship between language and ideas beliefs and reasoning in the Logic.

The Port-Royal theory was built on a Cartesian theory of ideas as non-imagistic conceptions innate to the pure intellect (independent of the senses). In Book III of his Essay concerning Human Understanding (1689) John Locke attempted to sever the Port-Royal theory from these Cartesian roots in order to develop an empiricist theory of language. He took this theory to have important consequences for the theory of classification (natural kinds) in science and for the nature and limits of religious belief.

Following the publication of Locke's Essay the Irish philosopher John Toland published a notorious and immediately controversial book Christianity Not Mysterious (1696) in which he argued that it followed from Locke's theory that certain religious sentences such as those used in Trinitarian theology were meaningless and so could not actually express beliefs. In Ireland and elsewhere a variety of responses to Toland were published. By far the most famous of these was due to George Berkeley. Only recently in the work of David Berman and others has it been recognized that the Introduction to Berkeley's Treatise on the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710) is intended in part as a response to Toland. In a later work Alciphron Berkeley responds to Toland more explicitly.

Berkeley's general strategy is to argue that words can be meaningful and express genuine beliefs without corresponding to ideas. Some commentators have argued that Berkeley provides a 'use theory' of language similar to the later Wittgenstein. We will discuss how Berkeley addresses these issues in the manuscript and published versions of the Introduction to the Principles and in the seventh dialogue of Alciphron. (The original of the manuscript version of the Introduction is held by TCD's Old Library.)

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
We typically assume that our minds have a causal impact on the world by affecting the motion of our bodies and thence the states of other physical objects in our environment. When a person gets up from the couch to rummage about in the fridge it is we say their desire for food and belief that there is desirable food in the fridge (which are states of their mind) that cause them to stand up walk to the kitchen and open the fridge. Similarly when someone stubs their toe it is we say the resulting sensation of pain (another mental state) that causes them to wince and say “Ow!” One of the most long-standing objections to mind-body dualism is that the dualist’s thesis that mind and body are distinct and irreducible to one another makes it difficult if not impossible to explain how the mind could cause such effects. This module will examine and evaluate various responses to this objection in the interest of arriving at a better understanding of how the mind interacts with the physical world. In pursuit of this goal we will consider a number of dualist and materialist theories of mental causation different varieties of dualism and how they are variously affected by the aforementioned objection the plausibility of the epiphenomenalist view that the mind is causally inert and various rival theories of causation in general.

By the end of the module students should be able to identify the core issues and debates at the heart of political discourse. Students will be able to use a variety of different theoretical and practical approaches to analysing political questions.
Module Learning Aims:
This course has three aims:

First it seeks to equip students with a basic theoretical knowledge of the key political questions and policy problems the world of politics experiences today.

Second it will furnish students with the fundamental conceptual and analytical tools used in the discipline of political science in the consideration of such questions.

Third it seeks to enable students to critically analyse the major political questions in Irish society and beyond.
Module Content:
There are six main sections in the course.

The first section considers the basic principles of politics and political philosophy including different conceptions of the nature of power and basic theories of political analysis. It focuses on questions such as how differing ideas about the nature of human motivation liberty equality and justice inform political decision-making. In this section key concepts such as the state nation and political system are explored. We look at differing conceptions of the state and explore ideas about what purpose the state serves.

The second section examines key elements of a political system including the role of political institutions such as constitutions and electoral systems in shaping how society and government functions. We examine the idea and role of the separation of powers representation the executive and the judiciary.

Focusing on democratic theory this section explores the conditions that promote and constrain the emergence of democracy and examine authoritarian resilience and re-emergence in various parts of the world.

In section four theories of international relations are introduced and the impact of globalization on the sovereignty of states is assessed. Issues such as the use of terror by sub-state actors and questions about the key cleavages in international politics are discussed.

Section five examines how citizens and social scientists interrogate the world around them. Is it ever possible for human beings to be completely objective? The role of the media in framing political discourse and setting agendas is explored with particular attention focusing on the media in Ireland. We also examine the claim that research by political scientists is ‘scientific’.

In the final part of the course we focus on Irish public policy. In particular we will look at key issues such as housing public and private debt as well as the debates around economic policy and fiscal management. The many challenges posed to Ireland in the context of Brexit will underpin the content of this part of the course.

At the end of this course it is expected that students will have learned a detailed understanding of: how the EU institutions work how public policy is formed and theoretical characterisations of the policy making process.
Module Content:
The underlying theme of this course is to examine the extent to which the EU’s institutional framework and policy environment provide evidence of deepening integration where national borders are increasingly irrelevant. This course examines various theoretical approaches of relevance to understanding the evolution of the EU and examines the EU its institutions and policies in the light of these approaches.

PO3690,Representation And Public Opinion,Caroline McEvoy,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

Understand the various aspects of public opinion and political participation in contemporary democracies

Assess the nature of individual and mass political beliefs

Explore the strengths and weaknesses of survey research and opinion polling for assessing public preferences

Examine the complex roles of public opinion and representation in democratic theory and practice

Consider the consequences of political behavior for elections public policy and representation

Describe and evaluate different interpretations of what it means for a citizen to be politically represented

Assess the role of political parties and other political actors in translating voter preferences to policy outcomes in contemporary democracies

Consider the strengths and weaknesses of different voting and party systems in terms of their ability to reflect and respond to changes in public opinion

Examine inequalities in representation and explore whether or not some groups of citizens are better represented than others.
Module Learning Aims:
The aim of the module is twofold. The first goal is to deepen students’ understanding of how public opinion is formed and shaped in the political space. It aims to make students aware of the both complexity of the concept and of its centrality to democratic theory and practice. The second goal is to build students’ understanding of political representation to theoretically explore its meaning and to comparatively assess how well different institutions and systems function as instruments of representative democracy
Module Content:
This course draws insights into those who are at of the heart of democracy – the people. It is designed to explore how public opinion is made ‘present’ in the political space. We will be studying how the preferences of the public are communicated to elected officials and transformed through the legislative process into political outcomes. Some of the questions that will be addressed in class include where does public opinion come from? How are the preferences of individuals formed and shaped – through ideology party identity social groups economic self-interest or the media? How do citizens participate in the political process and why do they vote the way they do? What is political representation? What does it mean to be a representative? How do scholars measure public opinion and representation? Do differences in voting and party systems influence the level of democratic representation? Are some citizens better represented than others?

The first part of the course will focus on opinion formation considering the long and short term influences that shape public opinion and how citizens use the political process to have their voices heard. This section will also consider developments in opinion research and the challenges faced by scholars in measuring and understanding citizen preferences.

The second part of the course will focus on how public opinion is translated into policy outcomes. We will be studying political representation both theoretically and empirically with a comparative focus on political systems in the USA and Europe.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Politics as the noted political scientist Harold Lasswell once said is all about who gets what when and how. It is about distribution of benefits and burdens of all kinds whether they be rights duties opportunities material goods or plain old-fashioned cash. Anyone concerned with politics must therefore be concerned with principles that ought to govern this distribution. These principles are principles of justice. This module is focused on understanding these principles and applying them to crucial issues in contemporary politics.

The first half of the module will focus on how to identify these principles and the different contemporary schools of thought regarding justice – utilitarianism liberal egalitarianism and libertarianism. We will examine the respective advantages and disadvantages of each of these theories. The second half of the module will focus on the applications of these theories to the reality of major issues in contemporary politics. These will include looking at issues such as gender democracy poverty climate change human rights torture migration and modern slavery. For example you will be considering questions such as what if anything are we required to do to mitigate against climate change? Who is responsible for this mitigation? What sort of democratic institutions should we have? How much should we be doing to combat poverty in the world? Is torture ever permissible? What are human rights? This part of the module will consider these and other big questions in relation to how we should conduct politics.

Module Learning Aims:
MT 2018: To build students’ understanding of the relationship between the military and politics. The module will provide students with a detailed understanding of how the military influences politics in a variety of spheres both domestic and international. It will explain the challenge of civil-military relations and the effects that civil-military relations can have on political development.

HT 2019: This module aims to build students’ understanding of the causal mechanisms by which the mass media coverage is shaped and the effects that media content has on political life.
Module Content:
MT 2018: In this term the module studies the role of militaries in politics. One of the key strategic dilemmas raised by the military is that an organization that has the power to protect a polity from external threats has the potential to threaten the polity itself. The goal of this module is to help understand how this dilemma has been resolved in a variety of contexts. It explores the role that the military played in state formation how civilian control over the military is institutionalised or breaks down how the military affects domestic competition and conflict and how the military can affect foreign policy. These issues are examined cross-nationally including developing and developed countries democracies and non-democracies.

HT 2019: The mass media have long been considered the ‘fourth estate’ responsible for watching over government and providing the critical information and opinion by which citizens evaluate political issues actors and events. For this reason we will investigate the effects of differential media coverage on public opinion of major contemporary issues namely elections welfare policy immigration and terrorism. However many contend that the media are not simply the means by which information is transferred but constitute political actors themselves. We therefore also explore the causal factors that may shape media coverage and how this varies both across media organisations and across time and space. Finally technological innovation has revolutionised the mass media landscape. We will engage in depth with key developments such as the rise of soft news eroding trust in media and journalism social media and polarisation and the rise (and meaning) of fake news and the online information wars.

Module Learning Aims:
The goal of this module is to introduce students to the practice of data analysis at an introductory postgraduate level. More than ever before political science research relies upon data—information about people firms nations etc. that can be standardized compared and analyzed en masse. Political scientists analyze data with an eye to explaining the social world. Not all political scientists perform data analysis of course but because data analysis provides so much of our knowledge about politics every student of the subject must now know at least a little about how it works. Love it or hate it—and lots of people hate it—there’s no escaping data.

 
Module Content:
Students will learn about quantitative research methods through lectures and readings. Specifically they gain a basic understanding of statistics and the classical model of hypothesis testing as well as a number of key statistical tests used by social scientists in hypothesis testing. In tutorial they will develop their knowledge of Stata a useful statistical software package. (Students are not obliged to use this particular package.) Each student will then write an original research paper that asks a social science question and uses one or more statistical tests to answer it.

Software:

We have assigned the statistical software package Stata for the module. It is relatively easy to use. Stata is available on the computers in theBeckett Lab the Riada PC Lab and other computer labs on campus. Students may use a different software package (SPSS R etc.) should they so choose but it is their responsibility both to learn the package (i.e. no assistance will be guaranteed by either the instructors or the teaching assistant) and to use the package to complete the module’s assignments.

Research Ethics:

In conducting their research students should be aware of Trinity College’s Policy on Good Research Practice which can be found at
https://www.tcd.ie/research/dean/TCDGoodResearchPractice.pdf
They should also be aware of the Ethics Policy of Trinity’s School of Social Sciences and Philosophy which is at

(1) to get familiar with the well-known literature in the study of international conflict

(2) to develop the skills of critical judgment

(3) to find interesting topics that turn into your individual project. This course explores a variety of topics to grasp the patterns of international conflict over the 19th and 20th century with a primary emphasis on strategic interaction among states. Scholars have long investigated the origins of war and have pointed out some factors such as leaders domestic political systems and international system. However the research on strategic interactions in the past twenty years has shown the importance of understandings of political decisions behind international conflicts. That is attributes of leaders and states and/or characteristics of international system are not always translated into international outcomes in an intuitive way. In order to prevent war it is necessary to understand state behavior in crisis. The class covers various topics such as the structural causes and the behavioral origins of war bargaining deterrence democratic peace economic interdependence and international conflict and alliance politics.

Apply this understanding to real-world problems of international relations.

Make and criticize arguments regarding how our international system ought to function and what our obligations in that system ought to be.


 
Module Learning Aims:
As the third millennium begins many of the most important moral problems facing the human race transcend national boundaries. Climate change terrorism pandemics human rights humanitarian intervention—all raise questions that are difficult to answer in a purely national context. For this reason the concerned moral agent increasingly needs to take on a global perspective.


Politics in the words of the political scientist Harold Lasswell is all about who gets what when and how. In that sense all of these global problems are deeply political. Either they concern questions of who is entitled to what (rights opportunities material goods) or else they involve figuring out what to do when someone’s entitlements are violated (through war or terrorism for example). The moral principles that govern who gets what when and how are principles of justice. Addressing the moral problems of our day thus requires principles of global justice. These principles will be the focus of the module.

 
Module Content:
In this module students will examine contemporary debates within political theory relating to global justice. Some of those debates address questions at a social level. What obligations does the First World have towards the Third? What makes a war a just war? Other debates deal with questions of individual political obligation. If global poverty is unjust how much money should I be giving to Oxfam? Each student will sample the relevant literature surrounding these questions and use that literature to examine a topic of his/her own choosing through a seminar paper.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The current economic crisis has thrown the intimate links between politics and the economy into sharp relief. On the one hand the evolution of the crisis and the policy response cannot be explained by economic factors alone: both things have been strongly influenced by politics. On the other hand the experience of the crisis highlights the impact of global economic factors on political choices made at the national level. In this course we will study these relationships examining the role of politics in the development of the crisis and the impact of the crisis on political outcomes. It goes without saying that this is a huge area and we cannot hope to cover all of the issues involved in five sessions. The topics have been chosen therefore (a) with a view to providing a basic understanding of the essential components of the crisis and (b) with a particular focus on areas where politics forms an important part of the story. (Note that while the critical focus of this course is on the political economy of the global crisis wherever possible I have included some material on the Irish case to allow us during the course of our discussions to bring some comparative perspective to the Irish story.)

A note on the relationship with PO8025 and PO8024.
The three political economy half-modules which I will be teaching this term (PO8024 PO8025 and PO8026) are designed so that they can be taken independently (i.e. no one half-module requires a familiarity with the material in either of the other two). Any student is therefore welcome to select any one of these half-modules as interest dictates.
It is also worth noting however that the issues involved in all three half-modules are inter-related so that together the three provide broad coverage of some of the most pressing issues in the fields of comparative and international political economy today. Selecting two of these modules will therefore provide a firm theoretical grounding for students with a particular interest in these areas (CPE/IPE). For those who are planning on selecting two of these courses special assessment options apply (see below).

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module introduces students to the discipline of Sociology. Sociology enables us to understand and critically explore the social world in which we live. The module introduces students to the distinctive questions that sociologists ask about human society and the theories concepts and analytical tools used in the search for answers. Students are encouraged to develop a ‘sociological imagination’ in order to understand the inter-relationships and dependencies between the individual society and wider global processes.
The first term of the module explores why we need a sociological approach to the explanation of human behaviour and the historical emergence of sociology as a way of understanding key issues in social life. It then examines core sociological processes such as how social norms shape behaviour the structure of social networks and the roles of social capital social conformism and group identity. The module also examines issues of social stratification and inequality and the role of educational reproduction in this plus the dynamics of social movements and collective action. The module provides an introduction to the nature of explanation in sociology as well as the methods which sociologists use to gather data and analyse their data.
The second term of the module applies different sociological concepts to empirical research using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Topics covered include patterns of migration demographic transformation and its relationship to change in the nature of occupations family form and gender roles. The module will also examine the consequences of these changes for social inequalities. In addition the module will examine some of the policy responses to these changes and how they vary across different countries in Europe and North America. Special attention is given to the rapid social demographic and cultural changes that have occurred in the Irish society in recent decades.

The first half of the module looks at the social construction of gender and how it shapes the organisation of education and working lives. It introduces theoretical explanations for gender differences and examines them in areas such as education work housework childcare and social policies. Examples from Ireland are used to illustrate the shifting dynamics of gender and work in recent decades alongside international perspectives which provide a comparative view of change.
The second half of the module builds on the first by examining in detail a central social institution: the family. Critical questions for understanding contemporary societies and family relations will be discussed using current theoretical and empirical approaches: How can we conceptualise operationalise and investigate family relations today? Has the nuclear family always held the same status in Western societies over the last centuries? Which demographic changes have occurred in family life and family relations over the last decades? How does the family work as an institution in (re)producing social inequalities? Which is the role of social policy in influencing family outcomes across different national contexts?

Part I of the module focuses on social movements seeking to understand what social movements are how they work and what effects they have. The course looks at a variety of social movements in Ireland and beyond and explores them using theory and practical reflection on the movements. We ask what distinguishes social movements from mere protest groups. We study how social movements work and what they achieve. We also look at why people get involved and stay involved in movements dedicated to social change. There is a strong practical element to the course with visiting speakers from social movements in Ireland discussing their own movement activities.

Part II of this course introduces students to sociological understandings of power and the state. We approach this task by questioning the orthodoxy that the modern state – liberal democratic national market-oriented – that emerged in Europe since the 16th Century is the ‘telos‘ (end-point) to which all humanity might aspire. This questioning is prompted by the manner in which the modern state and its institutions have been exported and imposed on the rest of the world as a result of colonization and decolonization and more recently in the name of conflict resolution and good governance (also known as the liberal peace project). In doing so the module critically explores issues such as state power; race gender and state; liberal interventionism in deeply divided societies; state violence and legitimacy; and forms of resistance.

This module provides students with a thorough grounding in the theory of the social sciences and the specific form that it takes in sociology. In Michaelmas Term Jemimah Bailey introduces key theorists both classical and more contemporary and explores how these theorists have addressed core themes in sociological inquiry. The course will explore how social theories seek to explain social change and critically examine ideas about the individual and society social conflict and the nature of sociology. The class will look at the work of Marx Durkheim Weber Simmel Parsons Foucault Giddens and Bourdieu and examine the concepts of functionalism conflict theory social interactionism symbolic interactionism hegemony cultural capital and habitus. Contemporary social theory has been critiqued as being predominantly North-Western (white) middle class and masculinist in its influences and perspectives. The Michaelmas Term concludes by looking at some of the critiques from feminist and black perspectives.

In Hilary Term Richard Layte identifies key issues in the conceptualisation of social life and the impact of these for the form of explanation offered. Specific conceptual devices to solve these issues are identified and students are taught how to deploy these concepts and mechanisms to provide insight into different sociological phenomena. The course provides students with a structured understanding of what constitutes an explanation in the social sciences and makes a social theory sociological i.e. an ability to integrate social network and group context into models of human behaviour social interaction and change in these. The course provides students with different models of social processes as well as a toolkit of social concepts and processes with which they can build powerful hypotheses to understand and explain phenomena in the social sciences.

We will focus on the period after WWII starting with UNESCO’s attempt to reassert humanism and the possibility of freedom from and resistance to tyranny. In this strand we will explore existentialism symbolic interactionism and situationism. With the renewed challenge to colonialism in the 1940s and 50s came the realisation that humanism was itself implicated in oppression and tyranny. In this strand we will explore poststructuralist theory with a particular focus on notions of identity and subjection. The module will end by looking at some recent attempts to re-think notions of freedom/resistance and power/oppression.

 Part I: Theories of Globalization

The first part of this module deals with theories of globalization. Globalization and Development are two much discussed and debated concepts. How should we understand and address them today? How are they linked? What are the trends in both globalization and development? How is our understanding of both globalization and development changing in light of the recent global economic crisis and persistent systemic weaknesses? Can an institutionalist approach improve thinking and practice in development? We will investigate the trends that are going to shape the world in the coming decades: increased interconnectedness crises in existing economic political and social institutions within nations and internationally; increasing pressure on natural resources; huge demographic shifts; a shifting in the geo-political balance of power specifically the rise of China and India.

Part II:

Globalization and Development are two much discussed and debated concepts. As a systematic study of human interaction and behaviour sociology offers us the theoretical and conceptual tools to uncover how social actors (institutions; civil society; businesses; migrants; consumers; terrorists) shape global processes. In this module we look at who are the actors in development and how they relate to each other and how this impacts the ongoing construction of the rules and institutions of our world. We examine new and unexpected “global governors” such as international sport federations. We look at the public (us) as an actor and at how we can improve our generally weaker positions through certain strategies of cooperation. We also explore climate change - what is the impact of these global power struggles on the environment? We also look at how and why the human body and human culture matter in globalization and development through a gender perspective. What happens to the dominant theories of development and globalization when the body matters such as breastfeeding are put centre stage? We also explore the centrality of gender and women’s labour (paid and unpaid) to global economies. The turbulence of recent history has propelled the issues of religious identity conflict and terrorism to the forefront of academic studies and the public consciousness. Given this what role does globalization and specific forms of development play in explaining what Samuel Huntington describes as the ‘clash of civilisations’ between the West and non-West? In addition the propensity of the West to impose particular forms of governance and economies as ideal forms of conflict resolution has been the subject of much recent debate. But do such dominant models resolve manage or exacerbate conflict?

The second part provides a critical commentary on the widespread notion that development and globalisation are processes that transfer western knowledge to traditional cultures. On the one hand it explores indigenous systems of knowledge (agricultural ecological medical astronomical) which pose serious questions for western ‘science’. On the other hand it argues that the west has not simply exported ‘science’ ‘knowledge’ or ‘development’ to the rest of the world but has less consciously exported a series of values or a way of life - in short - ‘culture’. The module follows these ideas through a variety of areas: agriculture and rural development religion and missionising health and medicine sport tourism and music.

Part I of the module builds on the broad introduction to social research in second year which explored the range of techniques employed in qualitative methods overviewed basic methods of qualitative analysis and began the process of developing written arguments. In particular the module will focus on designing and formulating a research project with corresponding sampling data collection and analysis methods. This part of the module will also particularly focus on research proposal requirements.

 
Part II of the module continues on from the introduction to quantitative methods in second year which covered survey design sampling data collection techniques and basic descriptive analysis methods. The various stages of designing a quantitative research project are examined with particular focus on data analysis. As generalisations from the sample to the population are of key importance in quantitative research statistical inference is introduced and inferential statistics are applied. This is accompanied by instruction in using SPSS software to analyse numerical data

The module provides an overview of issues surrounding race ethnicity and identity by providing a theoretical understanding of the issues and investigating recent developments in immigration racism and the politics of multiculturalism and integration in Ireland Europe and further afield.
Part I of the module – States Migration and Ethnicity – aims to promote reflection on the interactions between states identity ethnicity and race. We will explore how immigration is affecting contemporary West European politics and society. We will examine the role of the state in managing ‘difference’ particularly the concepts of multiculturalism citizenship and integration. Issues such as refuge and asylum borders the rise of far right parties and immigrant protests and riots will be examined in the context of Europe.
Part II of the module – Race Ethnicity and Identity: A Theoretical Introduction – explores how ideas of race ethnicity and identity are socially constructed before investigating the origins of nationalism and processes of racialisation. We will examine sociological theories of the racial state learn how to analyse media representations of race and ethnicity and situate race and ethnicity within social political and economic processes. Students will gain an overview of various approaches to 'race' including exploring how differences ‘beyond race’ such as hybridity and diaspora are negotiated. Finally we will ask if it is possible to move 'beyond race' and look at the possibilities and the problems of anti-racism.

Part II of the module States Migration and Ethnicity aims to promote further reflection on the interactions between states identity ethnicity and race. First building on Part I we will examine social constructions of race and racism before investigating theories on identity and the origins of nationalism. We will draw on readings and case studies from Western Europe but also from the Americas Africa and Asia.We will then move to an exploration of how immigration is affecting contemporary West European politics and society. We will cover the topics of citizenship policies immigrant ‘integration’ and the role of the state the rise of far right parties and immigrant protests and riots. The course ends with a comparative examination of immigration in the United States and Europe.

Part I – Markets States and Work – introduces students to important concepts theories and empirical research in economic sociology and the sociology of work. The first section of the module discusses classical interpretations of the rise of ‘market society’ before analysing different systems of capitalism and welfare in Europe and the role of the state in shaping economies and societies and responding to pressures for institutional change. The second section focuses on contemporary experiences of work and unemployment in Western Europe including the relationship between skills and work services work flexible work and the impact of ‘globalisation’ on work. In particular we engage with debates on change and continuity in working lives in ‘post-industrial’ Europe. Finally in the third section Western European labour markets are analysed through the prism of labour migration. We examine policies on high skilled and low skilled labour immigration as well as foreign workers’ experiences in different labour markets in particular problems of employer discrimination and conflict with domestic workers.

 
Part II Sociology of Employment and Labour Markets provides students with a systematic introduction to two central and rapidly changing aspects of labour markets in advanced market economies the increasing participation and changing position of women and the role of migrants and the problem of their socio-economic integration. In the first part of the module which deals with the position of women on the labour market theories and empirical findings regarding the divisions of paid and unpaid labour labour market participation of women and wage and career inequality are discussed with a special emphasis on the interplay of individual decisions and formal and informal societal institutions. The second part focuses on migrant workers on the labour market. In this part the module discusses different types of migrants and the associated economic benefits the impact of migrants on the domestic labour market patterns of socio-economic integration and the underlying processes and the attitudes of the host population towards migrants.

Module Content:
 
 There is a renewed interest among liberal interventionists and peacemakers in sociology and anthropology. Hitherto the prevailing emphasis among liberal interventionists has been on ‘good governance’ and state-building as the way to resolve conflict. The failure of this approach is understood to be due to its ‘lack of anthropological sensitivity’ – hence the renewed interest in sociology/anthropology.

Part one of this module looks at conflict studies from the perspective of how conflicts occur and how they are managed and resolved. The module has a theoretical orientation towards a more holistic approach and understanding of the contested nature of identities in “deeply divided” societies. In doing so the course content offers students the theoretical and conceptual tools to critique dominant forms of conflict resolution. In particular we focus on the ‘liberal interventionist’ approach which is premised upon a belief that the existence of ‘good governance’ and a free market economy automatically signifies peace. Drawing upon critical scholarship (class gender) the module challenges the orthodoxy of such approaches suggesting that a genuine resolution of conflict requires a major overhaul of dominant Western approaches. While the module draws heavily from the ongoing endeavours for peace and conflict resolution in the North of Ireland reference will be made to other peace agreements and students are encouraged to review case studies that particularly interest them making links with other modules and wider reading.


Part two of the module offers a closer look at Israel/Palestine one of the major conflict zones of our time. Israel/Palestine is a paradigmatic example of a long running conflict and of a modern state which aims to ensure the ongoing dominance of a particular ethnic group. This part of the module examines both the conflict and the reactions of the various parties taking a critical look at Israeli and Palestinian responses to the conflict. We also examine international interventions in the conflict – both what has motivated the extraordinary international interest in Israel/Palestine and the effect of this involvement.

The class uses the particular issue of Israel/Palestine to develop an in-depth understanding of a conflict situation which has general applicability. Key debates that this class engages in is the use of human rights by parties in conflict situations problems with resistance strategies to oppression the representation of conflict and critiques of the role of outside intervention.

Module Content/Outline:

Over one in three people on the planet is already connected to the Internet and millions more become connected every month. We all live digital lives whether we are connected or not as the structures and norms in society are increasingly organized around the rapid creation and sharing of digital information. The technology is continuously changing as are some aspects of social behaviour but much of how people behave and patterns of power in society are unchanged. Partly because increased connectivity is merely an amplification of the expression of long-existing needs and behaviour but also because technology is but a tool and people and institutions use it to further their own priorities and agendas. This course places digital technologies in their socio-political-historical context explores the ideas around networks and examines how core institutions (work the economy the media government family politics) and norms (privacy sharing feeling rules) – are being impacted by new technologies.

In Part I we will explore the structure and features of social networks and their implications for collective behavior. We ask how are digital technologies changing who we connect with and the norms underpinning these connections. Why does the presentation of self merit renewed exploration in the digital era? What roles do law and social norms play in keeping anti-social behavior in check? What norms are evolving about what is acceptable behavior with digital devices and in mediated interaction and what is not? What is social netiquette? How is it evolving? What does privacy mean in the digital era? How are our relationships now conducted and shaped from friendship and family romantic to community? We will look at how people are navigating the social dilemmas that emerge with the integration of technology and connectedness into their waking and sleeping lives.

In Part 2 we explore how power and inequalities are being played out in the digital era. At the individual societal and international level we ask where does power lie in the digital era? Are old powerful institutions (states firms) being challenged successfully by newer ones such as Wikileaks and peer production? Are networked individuals like Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden heroes or traitors? Are achieving the goals of social movements and revolutions easier with technologies? Or harder? How are changing norms around privacy and sharing contributing to the shifts in production and power brought about by Big Data and surveillance? Do digital technologies serve authoritarianism as well as democracy? Misogyny as well as fourth wave feminism?

We look at the implications of social networks and digital technology on work and employment and explore the role of gaming in this and other spheres. We also consider the implications of those changes in terms of wealth and equality for those on both sides of both kinds of digital divide: access and differing levels of skills.

Module Learning Aims:
This module explores the relationship between race and the organisation of society by the state and its agencies by undertaking a critical examination of policies practices and legislation related to ethnic and racial issues in Ireland. The module will locate race and contemporary social policy in the context of the social cultural and political changes associated with globalisation and Europeanisation. In examining the problematic and contested nature of the concepts of race and ethnicity the module will examine how ascriptive classification (based on notions of race) conditions social policy and its delivery. This will involve exploring the principles underpinning particular sources of identity and difference and a consideration of how such recognition/representation may be occasioning policy deliberately and inadvertently. This exploration will include frameworks of equality anti racism and multiculturalism as interventions which seek to promote cultural pluralism and justice. 

The module will trace the development of policy regarding ethnic minorities in Ireland from the first significant piece of legislation concerning Travellers in 1963 through the various pieces of legislation and policy introduced since regarding Travellers asylum refugee and immigration issues. Thus in aiming to explore and develop students’ awareness of the role of social policy in ethnic and racial issues in an Irish context the module aims to put theory into context and deepen students’ understanding of how policy impacts on the daily lived experiences of members of minority ethnic communities refugees asylum seekers and immigrants.

On successful completion of this module you will have a critical understanding of:

western liberal approaches to the management or government of ethnic difference and communal conflict and the knowledge claims about conflict culture and identity that underpin them.

critiques of liberal intervention – Bruno Latour Mahood Mamdami Derek Gregory

why peacemaking rather than violence has become an object of study

biopower governmentality and their relationship to state sovereignty violence/exception liberal peace/intervention and colonialism

the role of social science in making populations and population categories legible

the relationship between violence power and knowledge; including social scientific knowledge


 
Module Learning Aims:
The question that this module seeks to address is: what if any role might sociology and/or anthropology play in conflict resolution and peacestudies? It is worth asking because of renewed interest in sociology and anthropology on the part of liberal interventionists. We will begin by looking at the role envisioned by John Brewer and Roger MacGinty. For both authors the problem is communal conflict and they argue that anthropology and sociology have the requisite expertise in ethnicity identity community inequality to comprehend and address communal conflict.

 
 In the first part of the module we will explore western liberal notions of communal conflict; the assumptions about violence culture race/ethnicity and identity that underpin these notions of communal conflict and the ‘solutions’ to communal conflict that they have licensed. we will then look at the work of several authors - eg Bruno Latour and Mahood Mamdami – who problematise these assumptions. The problem with liberal interventionism – even the critical liberal interventionism of Brewer and MacGinty – is that the West (because it it’s the repository of scientific knowledge) is positioned as the universal arbiter of peace/conflict and consequently lacks the conceptual tools to reflect on the reproduction of violence – communal and otherwise -- by Western liberal hegemony itself.

 
In the second part of the module [second semester] we will attempt to develop the conceptual tools to enable us to develop a reflexive critique of Western liberal conflict resolution and peacemaking [pacification]. Central to this will be understanding the forms of power sovereignty and governance that emerged with the nation in Europe and which still hold us in their sway. In doing so we will sketch alternatives to the roles envisioned by Brewer and MacGinty: not a sociology/anthropology of conflict but a sociology/anthropology of peacemaking/pacification/ liberal intervention and of resistance to the hegemony of the western liberal state.

 
This module has a serious theoretical orientation but the empirical touchstone is the peace process in Ireland but reference will be made to other peace agreements and students are encouraged to explore the cases studies that interest them.

Module Learning Aims:
This module focuses on the educational challenges arising from migration-related cultural and religious diversity in Europe and North America. The most important forms of migration that have shaped post-war Europe are colonial migration ‘guest worker’ migration repatriation of co-ethnic minorities in their country of origin (see Germany) illegal immigration circular and temporary migration and new forms of intra-European mobility. The question of the reception of and reaction to the political and educational changes evoked through immigration is central. Following an introduction into transatlantic theoretical approaches to the study of migration we adopt a case-study approach to compare and contrast similarities and differences within Europe and between Europe and North America. Educational systems have a crucial role in balancing cultural diversity and social cohesion. Our emphasis is on assessing educational policies and practices in old migration host societies (such as Germany Denmark Britain and Canada) as well as new migration hosts (including Greece Poland Ireland and Portugal). Although there are converging responses among countries both in education and society at large including antidiscrimination rights and a focus on language learning there is considerable divergence for instance with regard to transforming curricula textbooks and improving access to citizenship. Our discussion situates these educational responses into broader governmental approaches to migration. The module features two guest lectures.

Module Learning Aims:
The Israel/Palestine conflict offers a paradigmatic example of a conflict based on race and ethnicity and a modern state which aims to ensure the ongoing dominance of a particular ethnic group. This module examines both the conflict and the reactions of the various parties taking a critical look at Israeli and Palestinian responses to the conflict. The module also examines international interventions in the conflict – both what has motivated the extraordinary international interest in Israel/Palestine and the effect of this involvement.

The module uses the particular issue of Israel/Palestine to develop an in-depth understanding of a conflict situation which has general application. Key debates that this class engages in is the applicability of human rights to conflict situations problems with resistance strategies to oppression the representation of conflict and post-development critiques of the role of outside intervention.

The final two classes of the module will investigate the conflict in Colombia the longest running civil conflict in Latin America. Visiting speaker Jose Gutierrez will outline the background to the conflict and discuss theoretical approaches to the nature of civil conflict.

Each student is allocated a supervisor from among the Departmental and MPhil teaching staff. Dissertations can be library based or based on empirical research but they must consist of an independent original piece of research. Students are encouraged to select a research method they are comfortable with. Titles are submitted via the course coordinator by week 6 of the Hilary Term. Supervisors are allocated by the end of the Hilary Term and students are expected to work closely with their supervisors. During the final section of the research methods module students will be asked to make short presentations to help them formulate their proposals and receive feedback from their peers.
