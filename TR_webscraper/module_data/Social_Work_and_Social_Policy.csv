Some skills workshops take place before and during placement and these sessions have a peer support element where common yet challenging issues which arise for students can be dealt with. The aim is for students to equip themselves with the skills required to complete placements successfully. The group can assist in brainstorming solutions to typical problems that may arise in practice and in placement relationships/situations
Throughout the post placement sessions students raise issues which they themselves wish to reflect on or to develop further. Issues raised in previous years have been for example self-care/building resilience, dealing with hostile or aggressive clients, working in positive or negative environments, working effectively with colleagues and management, demonstrating confidence in MDT meetings , thinking on your feet , moving into role of professional and particular issues which were emotionally hard to manage for example suicide. Student develop the skills to continue to raise and address these kinds of issues effectively in their long term future practice.
Students can bring specific pieces of practice to sessions for reflective practice discussion such as identifying elements which impacted positively/negatively on work /student , the effect of particular skills or approaches , which skills and approaches were most effectively, what could have been done differently, what student happy to repeat etc peers may identify aspects which had not been considered and this usually leads to interesting and fruitful discussion Students should gain a better understanding of areas they find difficult , personal likes /dislikes in practice situations , personal strengths etc enabling students to better develop self evaluation (constructive criticism ) and monitor their own performance in the role.

SS7312,Perspectives On Deafness,John Bosco,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this course, graduates will be able to:

Describe the major milestones in Deaf history (e.g. establishment of Deaf education, formation of communities, the ‘Golden era’ of manualism, the rise of oralism, the Congress of Milan 1880, the introduction of oral education in Ireland and consequences thereof).

Describe the major philosophical influences on responses to deafness (e.g. legal, religious, educational, rehabilitation, normalisation, eugenics, human rights, socio-cultural views, medical responses to deafness).

Describe the medical model of deafness

Describe the social model of deafness

Describe the human rights agenda as it relates to the Deaf community

Reflect on various definitions of the Deaf Community

Define Deafhood

Situate Irish Deaf community experiences in a broader EU and global context

Outline contemporary responses to deafness and Deafhood

Describe the minority communities within the Deaf community (e.g. Deaf Travelers, Deaf people with disabilities, Deaf-blind people, Deaf gay/lesbians, Deaf people of race, Deaf people who are members of minority religious communities in Ireland, etc.)
Module Learning Aims:
This module is aimed at students with an interest in signed languages and Deaf people. It is designed to challenge pre-existing notions of how individuals and communities respond to being Deaf, particularly challenging medicalised views on deafness, and the “normalisation” or “rehabilitation” of deaf people within hearing society. We invite you on a journey of paradigm shifting: We ask if there is a culture of Deaf people, and if so, what does this mean. Can non-deaf people be part of the Deaf community? Is one born Deaf or does one become Deaf? What is Deafhood? How has hearing society responded to Deaf people? Have Deaf people been targeted by eugenic practices? Have “linguistic genocide” been practiced on Deaf communities? How have Deaf communities responded? 
Module Content:
This module introduces students to the range of ways in which deafness and Deaf people are categorised – by medical personnel, by hearing people, and by the Deaf community. Three major strands are covered: (1) Perspectives on Deafness: The Deaf Community, Culture and Historical Context (2) Medical, Social and Personal and (3) International Perspectives on Deafness

In (1) we examine the variety of societal responses to deafness over time. We begin with references to deafness and Deaf people in ancient times and trace changing attitudes to deafness, signed languages and Deafhood up until contemporary times. We also explore the notion of Deaf culture and community and consider the objective symbols and behavioural norms of this culture.

This module introduces a continuum of perspectives of Deafness, and examines the range of practical and political implications of these views. We also consider the range of implications that this can have on a Deaf person’s self-image. A range of views from Deaf deafened and hard of hearing people which have been pre-recorded are shared over the course of this module.

This module also considers different ways of being Deaf in the modern world, with special emphasis on the European experience of Deafness. In a European context, data from the Leonardo da Vinci projects, SIGNALL I & SIGNALL II, are drawn on (www.signallproject.com).

Module Learning Aims:
This course aims to impart a thorough understanding of qualitative research methodology and to help students to develop skills and competencies in the conduct of qualitative research.A central aim is to introduce the major research paradigms and techniques that are at the core of contemporary approaches used to study social phenomena
Module Content:
Qualitative Research Methods

Early lectures introduce the key concepts of qualitative research, beginning with the theoretical underpinnings of qualitative research, i.e. its roots in the interactionist and phenomenological paradigms of social sciences. A central aim is to introduce the major research paradigms and techniques that are at the core of contemporary approaches used to study social phenomena. Philosophical assumptions about the nature of reality (ontology) and about knowledge and how it can be attained (epistemology) will be explored. At the practical level of planning a research project, lectures will cover: access to research settings, sampling techniques, researcher roles, researching sensitive topics, and dealing with unanticipated challenges.

 A series of lectures throughout the first and second semesters will critically examine several data collection methods including the qualitative interview, focus groups, fieldwork and observation, ethnography, and mixed methods research techniques. These lectures will also cover the design of qualitative research instruments (i.e. interview schedules, focus group discussion guides). The course places a strong emphasis on the individual interview, which is the most commonly used data collection method within qualitative research. A number of workshop sessions will be dedicated to the planning and design of the interview-based qualitative group project which comprises 15% of the overall grade awarded for the M.Sc. (see below). During these workshops students will also have opportunities to practice their interviewing skills.

 During the second semester considerable time is devoted to the analysis of qualitative data, with a major focus on the Grounded Theory approach. Alternative approaches to qualitative data analysis are discussed, as are techniques and procedures for data entry, storage and management, coding and the development of category systems, analytic memo writing, and the identification of relationships between categories. Lectures during this semester also examine the criteria used in establishing and assessing the quality of research for the qualitative researcher, with specific attention to the issues of validity, reliability and reflexivity.

 Research Ethics

Ethical considerations are an integral part of all research projects. In recent years there has been increasing awareness of the need for ethical protocols and procedures which not only protect the interests and well-being of research participants, but also of the researcher, their host institution and funding body. In this module we explore the need for rigorous ethical protocols throughout all stages of the research process. This includes the research design phase, the recruitment of participants, the implementation of the research instrument, and the research interactions, the analysis of data, reporting and dissemination. This module is both analytical and applied, and culminates with a mock ethical review workshop where students have the opportunity to test-drive their ethical protocols in preparation for the submission of their thesis proposal to the School of Social Work and Social Policy Ethics Committee.

This course aims to impart a thorough understanding of qualitative research methodology and to help students to develop skills and competencies in the conduct of qualitative research.A central aim is to introduce the major research paradigms and techniques that are at the core of contemporary approaches used to study social phenomena
Module Content:
Qualitative Research Methods

Early lectures introduce the key concepts of qualitative research, beginning with the theoretical underpinnings of qualitative research, i.e. its roots in the interactionist and phenomenological paradigms of social sciences. A central aim is to introduce the major research paradigms and techniques that are at the core of contemporary approaches used to study social phenomena. Philosophical assumptions about the nature of reality (ontology) and about knowledge and how it can be attained (epistemology) will be explored. At the practical level of planning a research project, lectures will cover: access to research settings, sampling techniques, researcher roles, researching sensitive topics, and dealing with unanticipated challenges.

 A series of lectures throughout the first and second semesters will critically examine several data collection methods including the qualitative interview, focus groups, fieldwork and observation, ethnography, and mixed methods research techniques. These lectures will also cover the design of qualitative research instruments (i.e. interview schedules, focus group discussion guides). The course places a strong emphasis on the individual interview, which is the most commonly used data collection method within qualitative research. A number of workshop sessions will be dedicated to the planning and design of the interview-based qualitative group project which comprises 15% of the overall grade awarded for the M.Sc. (see below). During these workshops students will also have opportunities to practice their interviewing skills.

 During the second semester considerable time is devoted to the analysis of qualitative data, with a major focus on the Grounded Theory approach. Alternative approaches to qualitative data analysis are discussed, as are techniques and procedures for data entry, storage and management, coding and the development of category systems, analytic memo writing, and the identification of relationships between categories. Lectures during this semester also examine the criteria used in establishing and assessing the quality of research for the qualitative researcher, with specific attention to the issues of validity, reliability and reflexivity.

 Research Ethics

Ethical considerations are an integral part of all research projects. In recent years there has been increasing awareness of the need for ethical protocols and procedures which not only protect the interests and well-being of research participants, but also of the researcher, their host institution and funding body. In this module we explore the need for rigorous ethical protocols throughout all stages of the research process. This includes the research design phase, the recruitment of participants, the implementation of the research instrument, and the research interactions, the analysis of data, reporting and dissemination. This module is both analytical and applied, and culminates with a mock ethical review workshop where students have the opportunity to test-drive their ethical protocols in preparation for the submission of their thesis proposal to the School of Social Work and Social Policy Ethics Committee.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Research Design

This component of the module, delivered in the second semester, focuses on the process of designing research at both a conceptual and practical level. It reviews a broad range of research strategies and encourages students to: a) critically evaluate the implications of selecting different methods and; b) reflect upon the merits of alternative approaches. The course uses real world applied research examples and encourages students to apply their learning to the development of their own research dissertation proposals. Students are expected to begin to think about and develop ideas for their dissertation research from the early weeks of the second semester.

Evaluation Research

The evaluation component provides an introduction to the theory and practice of evaluation. It equips students with the skills to analyse critically important issues in the design, conduct and use of evaluation in a social context. Students will be able to understand the purposes, contexts, competing theories and models of monitoring and evaluation including ethical, methodological and political issues in evaluation research. The module will impart practical skills to students so that they may develop the technical proficiency to undertake project/programme monitoring and evaluation.

Accessing Resources

The object of this course is to equip students with the skills to access relevant resources. Computerised resources, including bibliographical databases, citation indexes, electronic journals and the Internet (websites, search engines and portals) facilitate this task. Students will be trained in how to plan searches, including using Boolean operators and truncation / wildcard symbols, and adding limits to searches, and how and where to access appropriate material from Irish and international sources. They will also be taught advanced use of the Internet, including specialist search engines. Students’ bibliographies in completed research projects should exhibit such skills.

Students will also be introduced to a number of primary and secondary data sources and their uses in research, e.g. official statistics, survey and census data, EUROSTAT statistics and data sets which are available for secondary use.

SS8003,Work Placement,,"Learning Outcomes:
Learning Outcomes: On successful completion of the work placement, students will be able to:

Apply their knowledge of social research theory and practice to a ‘real world’ research environment;

Apply their research skills (e.g. qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods research skills) within a work environment where social research activity is a major focus of that employment setting;

Demonstrate that they have gained experience in one or a number of the following research tasks: reviewing literature, data collection, data analysis, writing research findings, assisting with the dissemination of research findings, project administration;

Demonstrate experience and learning that enhances their career opportunities.
Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
The Work placement module carries 10 ECTS. Full-time students spend eight weeks on a work placement during the third semester (Trinity Term). Part-time students complete the work placement during the third semester of Year 2. Students already in relevant employment can complete their work placement in that setting. Exemptions from the work placement may be granted at the discretion of the Course Director in exceptional cases.

 
During the work placement students get the opportunity to work on research projects alongside experienced researchers/research teams within their host organisations. Each year students are offered placement opportunities with a range of the most reputable Irish research institutes and consultancies, Government Departments and semi-state agencies, as well as various professional organisations. Normally students are on work placement from mid-April to mid-June.

As far as possible, work placements for students are organised during Semester 2, using the following procedure:

v A list of available workplaces is distributed to students early in the second Semester.

v Students then submit, via email, a list of their three preferred placement choices to the Course Director, Dr. Paula Mayock (pmayock@tcd.ie) and Course Administrator, Laura Cusack (lcusack@tcd.ie) along with a copy of their Curriculum Vitae (CV).

v CVs are then circulated by the Course Administrator to each of the work placements selected by students.

v Following this, students are usually invited to attend for interview at all or a number of their selected work placements. 

 
While the M.Sc. Course Director and teaching team make every effort to assist students in finding a work placement, it is ultimately each student’s responsibility to secure a work placement. If a student is experiencing difficulty in this regard s/he is advised to contact the Course Director.

SS8200,Therapeutic Interventions Into Problem Drug & Alcohol Use,Course Coordinator,"Learning Outcomes:
Having completed this module, the student should:
• understand the concept of 'self-change' or spontaneous remission from problem drug and alcohol use;
• appreciate the tensions which exist between popular addiction treatment modalities and modalities for which there is a strong evidence base;
• understand the idea of addiction treatment as a shared responsibility across human services and service systems - involving in generic or non-specialist professionals - rather than the monopoly of the specialist;
• understand the practical difficulties which delay or prevent the delivery of brief, opportunistic interventions by primary care workers;
• understand the ideological and practical controversies arising from tensions between harm reduction and ‘recovery’-oriented treatment and rehabilitation systems.


 
Module Learning Aims:
This module, which deals with treatment and rehabilitation of problem drinkers and drug users, is aimed at helping students to become familiar with the main issues associated with the planning and delivery of services in this contentious area of the health and social service system. In particular, the aim is to clarify the difficulties involved in delivering treatment and rehabilitation services which are 'evidence-based' in an arena where the most popular services are frequently those for which the evidence base is weak or nonexistent. The module reviews the evidence supporting the use of the four-tier model of addiction treatment provision and the problems associated with sustaining ‘therapeutic commitment’ to addiction treatment in generic health and social service professionals. It also looks, both from a historic and present-day perspective, at the role played by private mental health care providers in the delivery of alcohol treatment, debates as to the cost effectiveness of residential addiction treatment, and at controversial views concerning the ‘addiction treatment industry’. Similarly, it looks at the transitional difficulties for statutory health authorities in moving from a traditional system of grant aiding voluntary agencies to a system of detailed service level agreement. The module focuses on ongoing debate as to the ethics of indefinite methadone maintenance, and widely divergent views as to whether such treatment may be deemed a pragmatic success or a form of state oppression of individuals already excluded from mainstream society. Finally, in relation to debate concerning dignity and respect for problem drug users, the module examines the ideal and the practice of service user consultation and involvement in treatment and rehabilitation.
