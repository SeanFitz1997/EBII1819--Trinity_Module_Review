African trypansomes   (8 lectures)  Derek Nolan

The aim of these lectures is to provide an introduction to African trypanosomes parasitic protozoans that cause sleeping sickness in humans and a related disease Nagana in cattle. These parasites are a major problem for human and veterinary health throughout sub Saharan Africa and serious barrier to economic development of the region. Perhaps the most striking feature of these parasites is that that they are exclusively extracellular. They grow and divide in the mammalian vasculature and consequently exposed the adaptive and innate defence responses of their mammalian hosts. In addition for a variety of reasons African trypanosomes have been come a favourite model organism for molecular and cell biologists and many discoveries of broad significance have emerged from studies on these model unicellular eukaryotes. Areas where such discoveries have been reported will be illustrated in the lectures where appropriate. The course is organized into two parts.

Trypanosomes Part 1:

How are trypanosomes such as Trypanosoma brucei able to evade the host humoral immune response given that they are constantly exposed to this arm of the immune response?

How are these parasites able to interact with and acquire from their host essential macromolecular growth factors?

African trypansomes        

The aim of these lectures is to provide an introduction to African trypanosomes parasitic protozoans that cause sleeping sickness in humans and a related disease Nagana in cattle. These parasites are a major problem for human and veterinary health throughout sub Saharan Africa and serious barrier to economic development of the region. Perhaps the most striking feature of these parasites is that that they are exclusively extracellular. They grow and divide in the mammalian vasculature and consequently exposed the adaptive and innate defence responses of their mammalian hosts. In addition for a variety of reasons African trypanosomes have been come a favourite model organism for molecular and cell biologists and many discoveries of broad significance have emerged from studies on these model unicellular eukaryotes. Areas where such discoveries have been reported will be illustrated in the lectures where appropriate. The course is organized into two parts.

Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) which was initially considered a bizarre phenomenon limited to some plant species is now one of the hottest topics in molecular biology. Perhaps the most exciting application is the use of RNA interference (RNAi) — PTGS initiated by the introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) — as a tool to knock out expression of specific genes in a variety of organisms.

Synopsis
These lectures will cover modern aspects of biological NMR. In the early 1980s the advent of 2-dimensional NMR led to unprecedented growth in the application of NMR to solving protein structures. Following this the introduction of 3-dimensional NMR (and 4D NMR!) has enabled larger and more complex biological structures to be solved. In addition there are now numerous techniques used by the pharmaceutical industry to look at potential drug candidates binding to proteins (SAR by NMR). The lectures will cover these techniques and demonstrate how NMR is now one of the most powerful techniques available to both chemists and biochemists alike.

Meiotic cell cycle           Mark Carrington
Meiosis is the process central to the generation of variation in a population. During the prolonged prophase of the first meiotic division homologous chromosomes align and recombination occurs. The two successive cell divisions then produce a haploid gamete.
Lecture 1
Meiosis in fungi. Meiosis in mammals and the production of gametes. The origin of the germ line in flies and mammals. How does meiosis differ from mitosis?
Lecture 2
Which molecules are necessary for the unique events of the meiotic divisions and how do they work? How does the cell tolerate monopolar attachment to the spindle and how do sister chromatids remain attached during meiosis?
Mitotic cell cycle            Vincent Kelly
Lecture 1. The cell cycle & growth 
This lecture will cover some of the seminal discoveries of the cell cycle discussing the experiments performed on frog oocytes sea urchins and yeast. Key regulators of cell cycle progression as determined by these early studies MPF Cdc2/cdc28 wee1 and Cdc25 will be covered. Components of the mammalian cell cycle which have been discovered principally via bio-informatic approaches will be discussed including mammalian cyclin dependant kinases (CDKs) and cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitors (CKI).
Lecture 2. Start of the cell cycle G1
Signals for a cell to start proliferation are essential for initiation of the cell cycle. Examples will be provided of how growth signals through PI3K AKT mTOR and myc are co-ordinated to the uptake of amino-acids and glucose. In addition we will discuss how cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts must be altered to permit cell cycle progression.
Lecture 3. S-phase DNA replication & DNA repair checkpoints
The control of DNA replication is a major decision point of the cell cycle. This lecture will describe the replication licensing process the selection of the origin(s) of replication and the proteins that make up the origin replication complex e.g. Mcm Cdc6. If the DNA to be replicated is not properly loaded or is damaged the cell initiates various checkpoints i.e G1- and S-phase checkpoint. This lecture will cover the various protein complexes such as 911 the MRE11-Rad50-NBS1/gH2AX complex and the kinase pathways used to tell the cell to stop the cell cycle process including ATM & ATR BRCA1 Chk1 Chk2 and P53.

Lecture 5. Cancer metabolism and the tumor microenvironment
Many of the control points of cancer oncogenes tumor suppressor genes etc are intimately linked to metabolism which provides the cancer with the building blocks for growth. The unique microenvironment of cancer cells can help explain many of the changes in cancer metabolism and growth because cancer cells must adapt to this environment. This lecture will describe the changes that occur in hypoxia brought about by the HIF1a transcription factor.
Lecture 6. Angiogenesis and metastasis
The process by which cancer cells develop new blood supplies (angiogensis) is reliant on being able to remodel the tumor environment and the extracellular matrix. A discussion of how this remodelling occurs through matrix metalloproteinases and plasminogen will be given along with the cause and consequences of breaking cell-cell interactions.

Animal Procedures: Mr Peter Nowlan (Bioresources Unit TCD)
1 Lecture
The Purpose of this lecture course is to introduce Students to the basic requirements for working with animals. This is necessary if a full appreciation of animal related work is to be got from the projects. It is also a legal requirement that anybody involved in the use of animals for scientific purposes has appropriate training (EC directive 86/609)
 
 This module is not intended to be a comprehensive training course. To do this would
 require a much more detailed and extensive series of talks. Most of the training which
 will be required by students will be obtained by working in close contact with a technician and with experienced supervisors.

The golden rule should be always 'if you don't know ask somebody'.

The welfare of the animal and often the success of your Project will depend on using a correct approach to animals involved in your project.

 
 Even if you do not intend choosing a project which involves live animals you may do so in your future career. It will not be possible for anybody who does not pass the assessment to choose a project involving animals.

Dr Sarah Higgins Role of B cells in Health and Disease

Our understanding of the multiple physiological and pathological functions of B-cells continues to expand at a fascinating rate. A critical part of this expanding knowledge is the realization that B-cells can be responsible at least in part for diseases in which they had not been previously suspected and that their pathogenic influence can be mediated by multiple mechanisms. In turn the availability of effective agents capable of inducing profound and long-lasting B-cell depletion has prompted investigators to use this therapeutic approach in a large number of autoimmune diseases. Thus far the results have been very promising.

In this lecture series we shall discuss the role of B-cells in health and disease and the available evidence regarding the efficacy of B-cell depletion in human autoimmunity. Finally we will discuss some of the many challenges and opportunities that may arise from B cell therapy in the foreseeable future.

Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are important in migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation. Different families of CAM. Cell recruitment in the innate immune response: release of chemokines and changes in vasculature. Neutrophil migration – IL-8 fMLP. Cell rolling -> adhesion -> diapedesis -> extravasation. Effector functions of neutrophils. Cell recruitment and activation in the adaptive immune response – involvement of chemokines and CAM.

Module Learning Aims:
 The aim of these lectures is to provide an introduction to African trypanosomes parasitic protozoans that cause sleeping sickness in humans and a related disease Nagana in cattle. These parasites are a major problem for human and veterinary health throughout sub Saharan Africa and serious barrier to economic development of the region. Perhaps the most striking feature of these parasites is that that they are exclusively extracellular. They grow and divide in the mammalian vasculature and consequently exposed the adaptive and innate defence responses of their mammalian hosts. In addition for a variety of reasons African trypanosomes have been come a favourite model organism for molecular and cell biologists and many discoveries of broad significance have emerged from studies on these model unicellular eukaryotes. Areas where such discoveries have been reported will be illustrated in the lectures where appropriate. The course is organized into two parts.

Genetics of Common Disorders: Dr. Ross McManus
4 lectures IMM
Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Inflammatory bowel disease afflicts almost 0.5% of western populations and is characterised by a chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation. It is subdivided primarily into two broad phenotypes ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. There is a clear tendency for these conditions to be inherited although the pattern of inheritance is complex indicating that both are multifactorial diseases resulting from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. This lecture will review recent finding regarding the genetics of IBD.
Coeliac Disease: Coeliac Disease is a prevalent disease in Caucasian populations with a prevalence of susceptible individuals of approximately 1% although the actual frequency of individuals displaying clinical symptoms is lower at about 1:300. Coeliac disease affects the small intestine where dietary proteins derived from cereals provoke an immunological reaction which leads to extensive damage to the gut wall and atrophy of the small intestinal villi. This lecture willcover what has been learned in the recent past regarding the genetics of this disease and what this tells us about the cell biological processes at play.
MHC haplotypes & disease:
Dr. Ross Manus                                       2 lecture IMM
HLA and disease: The Major Histocompatibility Complex is situated on the short arm of chromosome 6 and is one of the most gene- dense regions of the human genome. Many of these genes code for proteins which play a role in the function of the immune system with genes in both the HLA Class I and II regions involved in antigen presentation and genes in the Class III/IV encoding many other proteins with diverse functions in immunity and inflammation. Furthermore many autoimmune or inflammatory diseases have been genetically linked to the MHC and it is clear the inherited variation in the MHC is a major determinant of susceptibility to these diseases. This lecture will describe the structure and content of the MHC and evidence of a causal association with inherited disease.

Gene-nutrient interactions & disease risk: Dr Anne Molloy
4 Lectures
Lecture 1: The importance of one-carbon metabolism in intermediary metabolism: One-carbon units (methyl methylene and formyl groups) are required both for synthesis and maintenance of DNA and to provide the methyl substrate for all biological methylation reactions which include important epigenetic and signalling events. In lecture 1 the biochemical pathways involved in one-carbon metabolism will be described. It will be shown that four vitamins - folate riboflavin (B2) pyridoxal phosphate (B6) and cobalamin (B12) - are required for optimal function of these pathways.
Lecture 2: Balancing nutrient status with optimal health: This lecture will consider the idea of how sub-optimal vitamin status might alter risk of chronic disease by unbalancing one-carbon metabolism. The specific example of folic acid and neural tube defects will be discussed as well as metabolic links between low B vitamin status and cardiovascular disease cancer and cognitive dysfunction.
Lecture 3: The 677C->T polymorphism in the folate dependent enzyme MTHFR: This lecture will consider an example of a common functional polymorphism that has important nutritional and disease implications.
Lecture 4: Nutrigenomics; a tapestry of Nature and Nurture. This lecture will round off the topic by considering (1) how nutrient dependent methylations of DNA and histones exert crucial epigenetic control over cellular protein synthesis and may influence events as disparate as prenatal imprinting and cancer susceptibility and (2) how the new technology of genome-wide association study (GWAS) is beginning to find many genetic factors that can influence an individual’s achievable nutrient status.

Haematology and haematological malignancies: Dr Tony McElligott
2 Lectures IMM
Introduction to Haematology and haematological malignancies: Haematological malignancies are a group of neoplasms that arise through malignant transformation of bone marrow derived cells. The great diversity seen in this group of malignancies reflects of the complexity of normal haematopoeisis and the immune system. The primary basis of classification is the distinction between tumours of lymphocytes and those of myeloid lineage. Haematological malignancies include leukaemias lymphomas and multiple myeloma and are defined and distinguished from one another according to clinical features microscopic morphology immunophenotype and molecular/genetic features.
Molecular biology of haematological malignancies and leukaemia: Many molecular genetic markers have been described in haematological malignancies including chromosomal translocations and rearrangements of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. These prognostic or predictive markers can be useful in guiding clinical management of patients and permit the development of very sensitive and specific assays for the detection of neoplastic cells. In addition these molecular markers have provided important clues in elucidating the biological mechanisms by which haematological malignancies develop and persist. More recently it has been recognised that epigenetic changes and aberrant expression of miRNAs are common features of some haematological malignancies and may play an important role in carcinogenesis.

3 Lectures IMM
Dr Aideen Long (IMM/ TCD)
Molecular targets in inflammatory disease/cancer
Normally cells respond to extracellular cues via cell surface receptors which when ligated initiate the activation of intracellular signaling pathways resulting in changes in gene expression and responses such as proliferation differentiation or apoptosis. These pathways comprise a range of signaling molecules including kinases phosphatases and G proteins which interact in a specific and sequential manner. The aberrant expression or mutation of key members of these signaling pathways is associated with the carcinogenic process in many cell types. Currently kinase inhibitors and blocking antibodies (targeting receptors) are being designed to specifically attenuate these pathways.

Module Learning Aims:
This module shows how computational resources can be mobilised to ivnestigate differences in immune molecules and immune responsiveness in different hosts. All species and all individuals within a species inhabit a particular ecologicla niche and have to make a living in that environment while exposed to a unique set of potential pathogens. Some of these pathological and environmental parameters are common between species and in those circumstances one species can serve as a model organism for a particular condition or disease. In all cases each surviving species has evolved a unique solution to pathological insult so no immune response or the genes and proteins involved in the process is exactly the same in any pair of species. The module investigates the similarities and differences among hosts with respect to the genes proteins pathways receptors and immunological effectors that are available to maintain structural and biochemical integrity in the face of external challenge. Some attention is given also to the genetic variability wihtin pathogenic species. This module will also introduce students to high-throughput and systems biology approaches to ivnestigating the immune response at a systems level.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
Immunological responses are controlled by the genes that code for contributing proteins and other molecules. Many immune genes are highly conserved and thus most human immune genes have homologues in other mammalian species. However there are important differences in the numbers and sequences of some of these genes which account for differences in immune responses both between species and individuals. Similarly variation in the copy numbers of immune genes or in their sequences can have major impact on their function in immunity (DNA RNA and protein leels) thus accounting for the significant inter-individual variation seen in all immune responses.

The aim of this module will be to provide sufficient background in basic genetics population genetics and epigenetics in order to understand the immunogenetics regulation of the immune response todifferent pathogens in different species. Species specific immune responses in vivo and in vitro will also be explored and genetic variation that predisposes individuals to disease will be discussed. Wtih the sequencing of genomes becoming quicker and cheaper it is now possile to explore the immunomes of any species by bioinformatic analyses and to identify the genes linked to disease susceptibility using technologies like Geome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). An important aim of this module is to familiarise students with key immunological studies in mice cattle horses pigs sheep birds and fish. Finally the threat of zoonotic infections to human health will be introduced and an appreciation for veterinary and human scientific collaboration to address major challenges to human health such as SARS avian flu and TB.
