BCGEOL,Planet Earth,Christopher Nicholas,"Learning Outcomes:
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

explain the basic origin and evolution of planet Earth and outline its dynamics

to discuss the major evolutionary episodes in the fossil record and how the planet changed over time with life
Module Learning Aims:
The module gives an introduction to our dynamic Planet Earth explains the natural principles and processes which govern how it works inside and out and retraces its geological history over the past four and a half billion years.
Module Content:
From the vastness of the Universe to the microscopic structure of mineral crystals from galaxy birth over billions of years to volcanic eruptions lasting only minutes; the science of geology sets out to investigate the origin and development of the planet the natural principles that govern it the processes that act in on and around it and the life that has evolved with it. Many sciences are conducted in the laboratory but to a geologist the Earth itself is the laboratory. In essence this module provides a beginner's guide to Planet Earth.
The module is divided into two main themes developed consecutively during the Semester. Firstly 'Earth in Space' investigates the origin of the Universe and our Solar System how Earth first formed its composition and structure. We will look at how Earth's internal dynamism constantly changes the landscape upon which we live; building mountains rifting continents apart causing earthquakes and triggering volcanic eruptions. The second theme 'Earth and Life' explores how the planet and the organisms that have lived on it evolved together over billions of years. Earth is presented on a journey through time with continents drifting back and forth across the face of the globe punctuated by episodes where the planet has diverted the course of evolution and conversely when life has changed the physical properties of the planet. We will investigate how evidence of past life can be preserved in rocks how species evolve and the geological causes which can drive them to extinction. The myriad of different rocks which together form the building blocks of the island of Ireland are also pieced together during this journey to highlight key events in the geological history of Ireland.

This module aims to provide students on the Masters in Development Practice with an overview of the argument for and against human induced climate change; what is climate change and how it is and will affect the natural dynamics of the planetary ecosystem; what are the potential physical changes to the planet which are and will occur; how concerns regarding the impacts fo climate change in the the developing world came to influence climate change agenda; the sustainable development implications of climate change; financing and mainstreaming adaption in the developing world; examination of the explanations and evidence for predicting responses to climate changes - including food security climate-conflict and climate migration. This course also provides an awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of computer-based modelling of climate change and in particular climate change impacts on public health globally.

Sub-Saharan Africa is generally regarded as the most vulnerable region in the world to climate change impacts. The implications of climate change for development in sub-Saharan Africa - and the strengths and weaknesses of approaches that are used to anticipate future climate change impacts - are a particular focus of this module.

Students on the module are without exception expected to read widely to think deeply to discuss fully and to analyse critically - and to work to a high standard both individually and as part of a group information on readings relevant to particular classes/discussions will be circulated in advance.

Module Learning Aims:
Dramatic and far-reaching changes have taken place over the two decades in how the international community views and responds to the inredibly complex development issues and challenges presented by societies emering from conflict and related disaster. 'Post-conflict' societies as they are often termed require multi-sectoral multi-agency action on a scale that is easily underestimated misunderstandings can occur with disastrous consequences due to misjudgements of the temporal spatial and systems dimensions of the transition to normalcy.

Those with a critical interest in development and reconstruction work need a deep understanding of societies in transition and more specifically of the roles practices and value systems of a variety of key actors and institutions at the supranational national and sub-national levels within this transition process. This module provides an introduction to and extensive practice in the core understandings and capabilities necessary to engage successfully in comprehensive-approach transitional analysis principled crisis response action and effective post-intervention review and policy learning.

Module Learning Aims:
Globalisation is often defined as the increased interconnectedness of places. However the dimensions of interconnection vary through time and space. Consequently globalisation is constantly in the process of evolution.  This advanced seminar seeks to understand the nature and evolution of globalisation in Africa. While Africa's share of world trade and investment fell during the 1970s through the 1990s the 2000s have been different as global resource scarcity increases and a new inter-regionalism is forged with the countries of Asia in particular. Some argue that there is now a new scramble for Africa with important political and human security implications. Africa is also thought to be the region of the world which will be most affected by climate change with some estimates suggesting that the value of African crop output may fall by 90% by 2100. The destruction of the forestland of the Congo River Basin is already thought to have reduced rainfall in the American mid-West by approximately 35% each February. Consequently the impacts of globalisation on the continent have global environmental implications.

The basic principles of radioactive decay and the fundamental theory and application of Rb-Sr isochrons and uranium-lead (U-Pb) zircon geochronology will also be explained.
Module Content:
We live on a dynamic planet that is continuously active in terms of generating new crust by partial melting as well as recycling this crust by rock weathering and chemical alteration processes. Understanding the geochemical behaviour of certain key elements allows us to better understand the processes that operate in our natural environment. We can use the geochemistry of rocks soil rivers and oceans to gain a better understanding of how our planet has evolved through time. This module provides the fundamental theory and application of how geochemistry can be used to study the contemporary environment and how we can use geochemistry of the rock record to extrapolate back through geological time.

 
The module is divided into three main themes:

“Magmatic Systems and Weathering” demonstrates the use of major element geochemistry in understanding magmatic processes and the rock weathering cycle. This will be illustrated using whole rock geochemistry of different rock types and soils from Ireland.

“Behaviour of Trace Elements” explains the theory of partition coefficients in partial melting and element mobility. We will also examine the use of trace element tectonic discrimination diagrams and examine how such diagrams are constructed. The use of Rare Earth Elements (REE) in rock and ocean chemistry will also be discussed.

“Radioactive Decay and Geochronology” will illustrate the theory behind different modes of radioactive decay and introduce the concept of using radiogenic isotopes for dating purposes. The theory and application of Rb-Sr isochrons will be explained as will secular evolution of ocean chemistry with respect to Sr and Nd isotopes. This part of the module will also introduce the basic theory and application of U-Pb zircon geochronology.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module provides a detailed consideration and comparison of the structure life cycles and general biology of animal groups based on lectures and practicals with additional self-learning exercises. The practical work involves online information and demonstrations of material from the Zoological Department’s extensive collections. The module will take an evolutionary and comparative rather than taxomonic perspective on animal diversity. The module will open by considering the origin of multicellular animal life in the oceans and the origin of the chordates and vertebrates followed by the conquest of land by the tetrapods and the escape into the air by the birds. Throughout the module will use form and function to draw comparisons across taxonomic groups such as considering locomotion such as flight across birds mammals reptiles and insects. The module will conclude by taking a macro-ecological perspective on the diversity of animal life in order to identify the main drivers of diversity at global long term scales.This lecture and practical module gives a broad grounding in the theoretical and practical basis of behavioural ecology. The subject is introduced with an overview of the diverse influences on an animal’s behaviour. Following this the roles of perception and attention in learning are explored before moving on to a more classic behavioural ecology course covering how animals obtain food avoid predators breed and communicate. The practical work provides students with experience in studying behaviour in both the field and the laboratory and provides training in behavioural recording techniques. It guides students through appropriate statistical analysis of the data sets collected in the practicals and in their presentation in written form. It includes work with live animals both in the laboratory and at Dublin Zoo.

Module Learning Aims:
Module Content:
This module will aim to put data collection and analysis in the context of research design and will be an important foundation for the Senior Sophister research project. The module consists of two parts. The emphasis will be practical with a more 'hands on' approach rather than the theory of statistics. Initially students will be taught about experimental design data collection and sampling and the use of spreadsheets for data entry. This will lead on to preliminary data exploration and issues of normality. Emphasis will be placed upon the importance of visually exploring the data prior to the use of statistical tests. Summary statistics including measures of centre and spread skewness kurtosis percentiles and boxplots will be covered. Then the module will move on to explore the concept of hypothesis testing and the need to compare two or more means. This will involve the use of t-tests and analysis of variance. Other types of data will also be introduced including the analysis of frequencies. The relationship between two variables in the context of regression analysis will also be explored. Finally a data set will be used to bring the entire process together starting with simple data exploration through summary statistics to more complex analyses. The aim of the second part of the module is to address in more detail the fundamentals of experimental design and to explore how previous projects were conducted. In addition students will learn how to write a moderatorship project proposal.
